# Network Database

A network database is a type of database model that organizes data using a graph structure, where records (also called nodes) are connected through multiple relationships, represented by links. Unlike the hierarchical model, which allows only one parent for each child, a network database allows each record to have multiple parent and child records, creating a more complex network of interrelated data.

In a network database, the connections between records are defined by set relationships, which allow more flexible access patterns compared to hierarchical models. This enables more complex queries and the representation of many-to-many relationships, making it suitable for applications where data is more interdependent.

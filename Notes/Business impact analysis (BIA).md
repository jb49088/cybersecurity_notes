# Business impact analysis (BIA)

A business impact analysis (BIA) is a systematic process used to identify and evaluate the potential effects of disruptions on an organizationâ€™s operations. It provides critical insights for prioritizing recovery efforts, allocating resources, and developing effective continuity plans.

- **Identification of Critical Functions:** Determining the essential business operations and processes that must be maintained or quickly restored after a disruption.
- **Impact Assessment:** Evaluating the financial, operational, and reputational consequences of disruptions.
- **Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs):** Establishing the maximum acceptable downtime for critical functions.
- **Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs):** Defining the maximum tolerable data loss for systems or processes.
- **Dependencies:** Identifying required systems, personnel, vendors, and other resources for sustaining operations.

The insights gained from a BIA guide recovery strategies, minimize downtime, and ensure continuity of critical operations during crises. Conducting a BIA strengthens organizational resilience and supports compliance with business continuity and disaster recovery standards.

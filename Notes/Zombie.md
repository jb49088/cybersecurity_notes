# Zombie

In cybersecurity, a zombie refers to a compromised computer or device that is controlled remotely by an attacker, often without the knowledge of the device's legitimate user. Zombies are typically part of a botnet, a network of infected machines used for malicious purposes such as launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, spreading malware, or sending spam.

Zombies become infected through various means, such as malware, phishing attacks, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the device's software. Once compromised, the zombie device may execute commands or perform tasks as directed by a **command-and-control (C2) server** without the userâ€™s consent.

The term "zombie" reflects the idea that the device is under the control of an external entity, much like a living being whose body is controlled by another force. Zombies are commonly used in large-scale cyberattacks, where they form a distributed network of compromised systems, making it difficult to track the origin of the attack.

[[üè∑Ô∏èPolicy]]

Corporate owned, personally enabled (COPE) is a model where the company purchases the device and allows employees to use it for both work and personal tasks. This setup strikes a balance between providing employees with flexibility while ensuring the organization retains full control over the device. The company controls the device configuration, management, and security, while employees can use it for personal activities like browsing the web or using social media.

Under COPE, the organization enforces corporate policies to protect company data. These policies may include encryption, data loss prevention, and the ability to remotely wipe the device if necessary. This model ensures that company data remains secure, even if an employee leaves the organization or the device is lost or stolen.

Since the device is company-owned, the organization can maintain oversight, making it easier to track, update, and secure the device. At the same time, employees benefit from using a device provided by the company, ensuring compatibility with work-related applications and resources.

# Site survey

Site surveys are crucial for understanding the current wireless environment and ensuring effective network deployment. The goal is to evaluate existing conditions and make informed decisions to optimize wireless coverage, avoid interference, and plan for future needs.

- **Determine existing wireless landscape:** Start by sampling the existing wireless spectrum to understand the current state of wireless communication in the area.
- **Identify existing access points:** It’s important to locate and assess existing access points, especially if you don’t have control over all of them. This will help you account for any limitations or potential conflicts.
- **Work around existing frequencies:** Consider the layout and plan accordingly for potential interference. Ensure that the frequencies used by your network will not overlap with others in the vicinity, to maintain clear and reliable signal transmission.
- **Plan for ongoing site surveys:** The wireless environment will evolve over time, so it’s important to plan for periodic site surveys. Changes in the environment, such as new access points or construction, can impact the network's performance.
- **Heat maps:** Use heat maps to visualize wireless signal strengths across the area. These maps can help identify areas with weak signal coverage and guide improvements to ensure complete coverage.

By conducting regular site surveys, you ensure that the wireless network remains efficient and effective, adapting to changing conditions and maintaining optimal performance.

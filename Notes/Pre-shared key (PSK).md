# Pre-shared key (PSK)

A pre-shared key (PSK) is a shared secret used for authentication between devices on a network, typically in wireless communications. It is a password or passphrase that is manually configured on both the client device and the access point (AP). When a device attempts to connect to the network, it must provide the correct PSK to gain access.

PSK is commonly used in Wi-Fi networks, especially in home or small office environments. It provides a simple and cost-effective way to secure wireless communication by requiring a key to join the network. PSK can be used in conjunction with WPA or WPA2 security protocols to encrypt the data transmitted over the network.

While PSK is easy to set up, it has some security limitations. If the key is shared widely or not changed regularly, it becomes vulnerable to brute-force attacks or unauthorized access. For more robust security, organizations often use enterprise solutions like WPA2-Enterprise, which employ more advanced authentication methods such as certificates or RADIUS servers.

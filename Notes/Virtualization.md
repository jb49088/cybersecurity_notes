# Virtualization

Virtualization is a technology that allows multiple operating systems (OS) to run on a single physical hardware platform. It enables the creation of virtual instances of computing resources, such as servers, storage, and network components, allowing for the simultaneous operation of different OS environments on the same physical machine.

Each application instance operates with its own dedicated OS, which provides isolation and ensures that applications do not interfere with one another. However, while virtualization offers flexibility and resource efficiency, it introduces overhead in terms of system performance and complexity. Additionally, the infrastructure required for virtualization, including specialized hypervisors and management tools, can be relatively expensive.

# Secure access service edge (SASE)

Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) is an advanced networking and security architecture designed to securely connect users to cloud-based services from virtually any location. As organizations increasingly adopt cloud services and enable remote work, SASE emerges as a modern solution that integrates network security and connectivity into a single, streamlined framework.

SASE is often described as a "next-generation VPN" because it provides a secure and efficient alternative to traditional VPNs, which may struggle to meet the demands of highly distributed and cloud-centric environments. With SASE, security technologies are hosted in the cloud, strategically positioned near existing cloud services. This proximity improves performance, reduces latency, and enhances the user experience.

The SASE framework includes lightweight client software installed on all user devices, ensuring automatic and consistent secure access. By consolidating security and networking functions into a unified platform, SASE simplifies management, strengthens security, and adapts seamlessly to the dynamic needs of modern enterprises.

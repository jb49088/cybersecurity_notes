# Corrective action report (CAR)

A corrective action report (CAR) is a formal document used to address and resolve non-conformities, problems, or issues identified during audits, inspections, or assessments. The CAR process ensures that root causes are identified and corrective actions are implemented to prevent the recurrence of the same issue.

- **Issue Description:** A detailed explanation of the non-conformity or problem identified.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** A thorough investigation into the underlying cause of the issue, often utilizing techniques like the "5 Whys" or fishbone diagrams.
- **Corrective Actions:** Specific steps that will be taken to correct the identified issue and prevent its recurrence.
- **Responsible Party:** The individual or team assigned to implement the corrective actions.
- **Timeline:** The schedule for implementing corrective actions and achieving resolution.
- **Verification:** A process to verify the effectiveness of the corrective actions once they have been implemented.

The CAR is used across various industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and IT, to maintain quality control, ensure compliance with standards, and improve overall performance.

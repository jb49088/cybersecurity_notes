# Zero-day

A zero-day refers to a vulnerability in software, hardware, or firmware that is unknown to the vendor or the public, leaving no opportunity for a patch or mitigation before exploitation. Zero-days are highly sought after by attackers due to their ability to bypass defenses and target systems without warning.

Zero-days pose significant security risks, as attackers can use them to steal data, deploy malware, or gain unauthorized access. Defenses include behavior-based security tools, proactive monitoring, and regular updates to reduce exposure to related vulnerabilities.

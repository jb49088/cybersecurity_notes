# Personal electronic device (PED)

A personal electronic device (PED) refers to any portable electronic device designed for individual use. These devices include smartphones, tablets, laptops, smartwatches, e-readers, and other handheld computing or communication tools. PEDs are widely used for personal, professional, and entertainment purposes.

- **Portable and user-centric:** PEDs are designed for mobility, allowing users to stay connected, work, and entertain themselves from anywhere.
- **Wireless connectivity:** Most PEDs support **Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,** and **cellular networks** for communication, data transfer, and internet access.
- **Security concerns:** PEDs can pose security risks, including **data breaches, unauthorized access, malware, and physical theft.** Organizations often implement policies like **mobile device management (MDM)** to secure corporate data on PEDs.
- **Regulatory restrictions:** In some environments, such as **airplanes, secure facilities,** and **military zones,** PED usage may be restricted due to security and safety concerns.
- **Integration with IoT:** Many PEDs connect with **Internet of Things (IoT) devices**, enabling smart home automation, health tracking, and remote device control.

As PEDs continue to evolve, they play a significant role in modern digital communication, productivity, and entertainment.

[[🏷️Linux command]]

Do you have some commands that you run very frequently while using the terminal? It could be `rm -r` or `ls -l`, or it could be something longer like `tar -xvzf`.

This is one of the productivity-boosting Linux commands you must know.

If you know a command that you run very often, it’s time to create an `alias`.

What’s an alias? In simple terms, it’s another name for a command that you’ve defined.

`alias lsl="ls -l"`

Or

`alias rmd="rm -r`

Now, every time you enter `lsl` or `rmd` in the terminal, you’ll receive the output that you’d have received if you had used the full commands.

The examples here are for really small commands that you can still type by hand every time. But in some situations where a command has too many arguments that you need to type, it’s best to create a shorthand version of the same.

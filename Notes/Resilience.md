# Resilience

Resilience refers to a systemâ€™s ability to maintain availability and recover quickly when something goes wrong. While no system is completely immune to failures, being resilient means having the capability to withstand disruptions and continue functioning as much as possible.

The resilience of a system depends on multiple variables, such as the root cause of the failure, the availability of replacement hardware, the ease of applying software patches, and the presence of redundant systems to prevent prolonged downtime. A resilient system is one that can quickly adapt and recover after an issue arises.

A key metric used to measure resilience is mean Time to Recover (MTTR), which tracks the average time it takes to restore a system or service after an outage. Reducing MTTR is essential for ensuring minimal disruption and maintaining continuous availability.

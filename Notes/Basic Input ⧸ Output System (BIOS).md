# Basic Input â§¸ Output System (BIOS)

BIOS stands for Basic Input/Output System. It is firmware embedded on a motherboard chip in a computer. The BIOS performs several crucial functions during the startup process, including:

1. **Power-On Self-Test (POST):** It checks the hardware components like the CPU, memory, and storage devices to ensure they are functioning correctly.

2. **Bootloader:** It locates and loads the operating system into the computer's memory from the storage device (such as a hard drive or SSD).

3. **Hardware Initialization:** It initializes and configures hardware components and peripherals connected to the computer.

4. **System Configuration:** It provides a setup interface (BIOS setup utility) that allows users to configure system settings, such as boot order, system clock, and hardware settings.

5. **System Management:** It facilitates communication between the operating system and hardware through low-level drivers.

In modern computers, the BIOS has been largely replaced or supplemented by UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), which offers more features and a more user-friendly interface. However, the term "BIOS" is still commonly used to refer to both BIOS and UEFI firmware.

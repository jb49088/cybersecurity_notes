# Attestation

Attestation refers to the process where an independent entity verifies and confirms that an organization's security practices, systems, or processes meet specific standards or requirements. It provides a formal declaration of compliance and security, building trust by demonstrating the integrity of data, software, or hardware.

Attestation often involves a documented review or audit process and is crucial for establishing confidence in the security posture of systems and operations.

- **Verification of integrity:** Confirms that systems, applications, or hardware have not been tampered with and are operating as intended.
- **Compliance assurance:** Validates adherence to security standards, such as PCI DSS, ISO 27001, or SOC 2, ensuring alignment with industry regulations.
- **Third-party review:** Independent entities or auditors perform the attestation to provide unbiased assurance of security and compliance.
- **Trust-building:** Demonstrates accountability and reliability to customers, partners, and regulators by verifying that robust security measures are in place.

Attestation is a critical element of maintaining secure and trustworthy systems, especially in environments where sensitive data or mission-critical operations are involved.

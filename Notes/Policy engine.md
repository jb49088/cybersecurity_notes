# Policy engine

A policy engine is the core component responsible for processing and applying security policies in an access control system. It evaluates rules, conditions, and contextual factors to determine whether access should be granted or denied. The policy engine is often embedded within a policy decision point (PDP) to automate security decisions.

- **Processing security policies**: Interprets and applies rules based on predefined access control policies.
- **Context-aware decision-making**: Considers factors such as user identity, device type, location, and risk level.
- **Integrating with external data sources**: Uses identity providers, threat intelligence, and compliance databases to inform decisions.

Policy engines play a crucial role in policy-based access control (PBAC) and zero trust security models, ensuring that access decisions are made dynamically and based on real-time risk assessments.

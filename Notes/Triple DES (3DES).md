[[üè∑Ô∏èSymmetric encryption algorithm]]

Triple DES (3DES) is an encryption algorithm that improves upon the older DES by applying the DES algorithm three times with different keys. It was developed to provide enhanced security after DES became vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to its short key length.

3DES encrypts data in 64-bit blocks, using either two or three 56-bit keys, effectively making the key length 112 or 168 bits. It operates through three stages: encryption, decryption, and re-encryption, offering stronger protection than standard DES. While more secure than DES, 3DES is still considered less efficient and secure compared to newer algorithms like AES.

It is gradually being phased out in favor of more modern encryption standards.

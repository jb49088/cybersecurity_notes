# Computer incident response team (CIRT)

A computer incident response team (CIRT) is a group of cybersecurity professionals responsible for managing and responding to cybersecurity incidents. Their primary goal is to detect, contain, and mitigate threats to minimize damage and restore normal operations as quickly as possible.

- **Incident detection:** CIRTs monitor systems for signs of malicious activity, such as unauthorized access, malware, or data breaches.
- **Incident response:** They coordinate efforts to contain and resolve incidents, ensuring that systems are restored to secure and operational states.
- **Root cause analysis:** CIRTs investigate incidents to identify the source of the attack and assess the extent of the damage.
- **Remediation and recovery:** They apply security patches, remove threats, and restore affected systems to prevent recurrence.
- **Post-incident review:** CIRTs conduct reviews to evaluate the response process, document lessons learned, and improve future incident management strategies.

By maintaining a proactive and structured approach to incident management, CIRTs ensure that organizations are prepared to handle cybersecurity threats effectively and maintain operational continuity.

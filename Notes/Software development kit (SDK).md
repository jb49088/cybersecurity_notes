# Software development kit (SDK)

A software development kit (SDK) is a collection of software tools, libraries, documentation, and sample code that developers use to create applications for specific platforms, frameworks, or services. SDKs provide everything needed to build, test, and deploy software applications, enabling developers to work more efficiently and integrate with third-party systems.

SDKs are typically tailored for specific operating systems, programming languages, or hardware, and they help standardize the development process for particular technologies or platforms.

- **Libraries and APIs:** Pre-written code and interfaces that simplify development by offering reusable functions and services.
- **Development tools:** Includes compilers, debuggers, and other utilities to aid in writing and testing code.
- **Documentation and tutorials:** Guides developers on how to use the tools and APIs, offering examples and best practices.
- **Platform-specific integration:** Helps developers build applications that are optimized for a specific operating system or device.
- **Debugging and testing support:** Tools that help developers identify and resolve issues within their applications before deployment.

SDKs are essential for accelerating development processes and enabling developers to create fully-functional applications that integrate seamlessly with platforms, services, or hardware.

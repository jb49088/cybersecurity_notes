# Security content automation protocol (SCAP)

The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP), managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), standardizes security operations across various tools like Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), and vulnerability scanners. By using shared criteria, SCAP ensures interoperability, simplifies compliance, and enables automation in large, diverse environments.

- **Unified Threat Evaluation**: Validates security configurations, confirms patch installations, and scans for breaches using standardized criteria.
- **Configuration Compliance**: Detects applications with known vulnerabilities, ensuring security across different operating systems and applications.
- **Interoperability**: Allows sharing of SCAP content between tools, streamlining processes in complex IT environments.
- **Automation**: Supports ongoing monitoring, notification and alerting, and remediation of noncompliant systems.

By integrating SCAP, organizations can enhance security efficiency, improve compliance, and reduce manual efforts in managing threats and vulnerabilities.

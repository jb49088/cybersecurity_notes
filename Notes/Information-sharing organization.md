An information-sharing organization facilitates the exchange of critical security details and threat intelligence among its members. These groups aim to improve collective security by disseminating real-time, high-quality information about cyber threats.

Key features of information-sharing organizations include:

- **Public threat intelligence:** Often sourced from classified or government-backed initiatives to provide actionable insights for broader security efforts.
- **Private threat intelligence:** Information contributed by private companies, leveraging their extensive resources and expertise to enhance threat understanding.
- **Collaborative sharing:** Promotes the dissemination of critical security details, fostering proactive responses to emerging threats through timely and reliable information exchange.

By participating in these organizations, entities across sectors can strengthen their defenses and collectively address cybersecurity challenges.

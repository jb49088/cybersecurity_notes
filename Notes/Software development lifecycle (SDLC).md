# Software development lifecycle (SDLC)

The software development lifecycle (SDLC), also known as the systems development lifecycle, provides a structured approach to creating applications or systems. It ensures that development processes meet customer requirements, stay within budget, and adhere to timelines.

- **Purpose:** Offers a framework for guiding the creation of software from idea to implementation, encompassing planning, development, testing, and deployment.
- **Flexibility in approach:** There are various methodologies to suit different projects, such as Agile, Waterfall, Scrum, or DevOps. The choice depends on the project's needs and constraints.
- **Customer-centric:** Focuses on understanding and delivering customer requirements to ensure the final product aligns with user expectations.
- **Management of complexities:** Addresses the challenge of coordinating many moving parts, such as development teams, stakeholders, and resources, to keep the project on track.
- **No universal solution:** While there isnâ€™t a single "best" approach, following a structured lifecycle minimizes risks and promotes successful outcomes.

SDLC frameworks are invaluable for creating efficient, reliable, and user-focused software.

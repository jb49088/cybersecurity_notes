[[üè∑Ô∏èBusiness agreement]]

A memorandum of agreement (MOA) is a formal document that outlines the terms and conditions for collaboration between two or more parties. It is more detailed and structured than a memorandum of understanding (MOU) but does not always have the same legal weight as a full contract.

- **Conditional agreement to objectives:** Both parties agree to the objectives and actions to be taken, but the agreement is conditional and may not involve enforceable promises.
- **Legal document without legal language:** While an MOA can be considered a legal document, it does not always contain the specific legal language typically found in formal contracts.
- **Not legally enforceable like a contract:** Though more formal than an MOU, an MOA may not include legally binding commitments, depending on the nature of the agreement.

MOAs are useful for setting clear expectations between parties and documenting agreed-upon actions, but they do not carry the same level of legal obligation as contracts.

# Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI)

Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) is a technology that hosts desktop operating systems on a centralized server, allowing users to access virtual desktops remotely. VDI provides a secure, scalable, and efficient way to manage desktop environments, commonly used in enterprise and remote work settings.

- **Centralized desktop management:** IT teams can deploy, update, and secure desktops from a single location.
- **Remote accessibility:** Users can access their virtual desktops from any device with an internet connection.
- **Enhanced security:** Data is stored on the server rather than local devices, reducing the risk of data breaches or loss.
- **Resource efficiency:** Multiple users share computing resources, reducing the need for high-performance local machines.
- **Scalability:** Organizations can easily add or remove virtual desktops based on demand.

VDI improves flexibility, security, and cost efficiency, making it ideal for businesses, educational institutions, and remote work environments.

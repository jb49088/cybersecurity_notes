# System hardening

System hardening is the process of enhancing the security of a system by reducing its attack surface and addressing potential vulnerabilities. It involves applying a series of best practices and configurations to minimize risks while maintaining system functionality.

Key steps in system hardening include disabling unnecessary services and applications, applying security patches and updates, and implementing secure configurations for operating systems and applications. The process also involves using strong authentication mechanisms, enabling firewalls, and ensuring that logging and monitoring systems are active to detect unauthorized activities.

Hardening extends to all system components, including servers, workstations, network devices, and applications. By eliminating redundant or unsecured features, organizations can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful cyberattacks.

System hardening is a fundamental practice in cybersecurity, helping to protect critical assets by creating a robust and resilient infrastructure. Regular reviews and updates to hardening procedures ensure that systems remain secure against evolving threats.

# Boolean

[[🏷️Data type]]

Boolean data is data that can only be one of two values: either `True` or `False`.

You should not place Boolean values in quotation marks. When you run the following code, it displays the Boolean value of `True`:

`print(True)`

You can also return a Boolean value by comparing numbers. Because 9 is not greater than 10, this code evaluates to `False`:

`print(9>10)`

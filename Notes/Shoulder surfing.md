# Shoulder Surfing

[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

Shoulder surfing is a type of social engineering attack where an attacker observes someone in a public or semi-public space in order to gather sensitive information. This technique is often used to steal personal data, passwords, or credit card information by simply watching someone as they type or interact with their devices. The attacker typically targets individuals who are unaware that their actions are being observed, whether on public transportation, in cafes, or in any environment where people use their smartphones, laptops, or ATMs.

Shoulder surfing is effective because it relies on the victim‚Äôs lack of awareness, rather than technical vulnerabilities. Attackers may look over a person‚Äôs shoulder, use reflective surfaces to view screens, or even stand behind someone in a line to gather valuable information without the victim noticing.

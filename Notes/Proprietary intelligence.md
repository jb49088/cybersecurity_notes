# Proprietary intelligence

Proprietary intelligence refers to threat information and insights provided by external services that specialize in gathering, analyzing, and correlating data from various sources. Organizations can purchase this information to enhance their security posture without performing the analysis themselves.

Key aspects of proprietary intelligence include:

- Threat intelligence services that offer advanced analytics and correlation of data from diverse sources, providing a comprehensive view of the threat landscape.
- Constant threat monitoring to identify new and emerging threats, enabling organizations to stay ahead of potential risks.
- Automated prevention workflows that streamline responses to detected threats, reducing reaction times and improving overall security efficiency.

By utilizing proprietary intelligence, organizations gain access to expert analysis and actionable insights, improving their ability to protect against sophisticated attacks.

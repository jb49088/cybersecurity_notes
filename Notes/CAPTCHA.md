There are two types of CAPTCHA tests. One scrambles and distorts a randomly generated sequence of letters and/or numbers and asks users to enter them into a text box.

You’ve likely had to pass a CAPTCHA test when accessing a web service that contains sensitive information, like an online bank account.

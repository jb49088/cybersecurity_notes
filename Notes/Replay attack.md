# Replay attack

[[🏷️Network attack]]

A replay attack involves capturing valid data transmitted over a network and reusing it to impersonate a legitimate user or system. Attackers require access to raw network data, often obtained through methods like network taps, ARP poisoning, or malware on the victim’s device.

Once the data is captured, such as authentication tokens or session information, attackers can replay it to gain unauthorized access or perform actions as the victim. Unlike on-path attacks, a replay attack does not rely on the victim’s workstation during the actual replay, making it a distinct method of exploitation.

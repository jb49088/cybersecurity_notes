[[üè∑Ô∏èFramework]]

System and Organization Controls (SOC) reports are third-party audit reports that evaluate the controls and processes of service organizations. These reports are crucial for providing assurance to customers about the effectiveness of the service organization's internal controls, particularly in relation to data security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. 

There are different types of SOC reports, including SOC 1 and SOC 2, each serving specific purposes:

- **SOC 1 Reports:** Evaluate the impact of a service organization's controls on the financial reporting of user entities.
	- **Focus:** Internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR).
	- **Users:** Primarily relevant to auditors and users of financial statements.
	- **Standards:** Based on the AICPA's SSAE 18 (Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 18).

- **SOC 2 Reports:** Evaluate the effectiveness of a service organization's controls relevant to the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of the data processed on behalf of the user entities.
	- **Focus:** Trust Service Criteria (TSC).
	- **Users:** Relevant to a broad range of stakeholders, including management, regulators, and customers.
	- **Standards:** Based on the AICPA's TSC.

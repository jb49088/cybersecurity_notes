[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

Eavesdropping is the act of secretly listening to private conversations or communications without the knowledge or consent of the individuals involved. This can occur in various forms, such as physical eavesdropping in person or through digital means, like intercepting phone calls, emails, or online chats. The purpose of eavesdropping is typically to gain unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential information.

Eavesdropping can be a serious violation of privacy, often used for malicious purposes like identity theft, corporate espionage, or surveillance. To protect against eavesdropping, it's important to use encryption for digital communications, be aware of your surroundings, and secure private conversations from unauthorized listeners.

# Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP)

Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) describe the methods used by threat actors to conduct cyber attacks. understanding TTP helps organizations anticipate, detect, and defend against security threats by analyzing how attackers operate.

- **Tactics:** The high-level objectives or goals of an attack, such as gaining initial access, persistence, or data exfiltration.
- **Techniques:** The specific methods used to achieve a tactic, such as phishing, credential dumping, or lateral movement.
- **Procedures:** The detailed implementation of a technique, often varying between different threat actors or attack campaigns.

By studying TTPs, security teams can improve threat intelligence, enhance detection capabilities, and develop proactive defense strategies against evolving cyber threats.

# Penetration testing strategies

There are three common penetration testing strategies: 

- **Open-box testing** is when the tester has the same privileged access that an internal developer would have—information like system architecture, data flow, and network diagrams. This strategy goes by several different names, including internal, full knowledge, white-box, and clear-box penetration testing.

- **Closed-box testing** is when the tester has little to no access to internal systems—similar to a malicious hacker. This strategy is sometimes referred to as external, black-box, or zero knowledge penetration testing.

- **Partial knowledge testing** is when the tester has limited access and knowledge of an internal system—for example, a customer service representative. This strategy is also known as gray-box testing.
    
Closed box testers tend to produce the most accurate simulations of a real-world attack. Nevertheless, each strategy produces valuable results by demonstrating how an attacker might infiltrate a system and what information they could access.

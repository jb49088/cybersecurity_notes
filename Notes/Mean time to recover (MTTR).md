# Mean time to recover (MTTR)

Mean time to recover (MTTR) measures the average time it takes to restore a system or component to its normal operating state after a failure has occurred. It is a critical metric in business continuity and disaster recovery planning, as it directly influences the amount of downtime experienced during an outage.

MTTR includes the time taken for detection, diagnosis, and recovery of the system. A lower MTTR indicates a faster recovery process, which helps minimize disruptions to services and operations. Reducing MTTR is often a primary goal in improving system resilience and ensuring that downtime has minimal impact on business processes.

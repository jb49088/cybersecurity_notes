# Data retention

Data retention involves managing and storing data for specified periods to meet organizational, regulatory, and operational requirements. A robust data retention strategy ensures data availability while balancing storage efficiency and compliance.

Key aspects of data retention include:

- Backing up data, considering how much to retain, where to store it, and managing copies, versions, and data lifecycles. Regularly purging old data ensures efficient storage use.
- Ensuring regulatory compliance by retaining data such as emails or corporate financial records as required by law.
- Supporting operational needs by maintaining backups to recover from accidental deletions or for disaster recovery purposes.
- Differentiating data by type and application to ensure critical data can be quickly accessed when needed.

By implementing a well-structured data retention policy, organizations can protect valuable information, comply with regulations, and maintain operational continuity.

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork security]]

Network-based firewalls are critical components of network security, deployed to monitor and control traffic across network boundaries. They offer advanced features for filtering, encryption, and routing to safeguard enterprise networks.

Key Features:

- **Traffic Filtering**: Network-based firewalls filter traffic by port numbers (OSI Layer 4) or application-level protocols (OSI Layer 7). Traditional firewalls focus on packet filtering and stateful inspection, while Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs) include features like application awareness and advanced threat detection.
- **Traffic Encryption**: These firewalls support Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to enable secure communication between sites, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.
- **Layer 3 Functionality**: Many firewalls act as Layer 3 devices (routers) and are typically positioned at the network's ingress or egress points. They often include Network Address Translation (NAT) to share public IP addresses among devices and support dynamic routing protocols with authentication.

Network-based firewalls combine these features to provide comprehensive protection, making them an essential part of modern network infrastructures.

# Backout plan

A backout plan is a predefined strategy for reverting to a previous state in case a planned change or deployment fails. It is an essential part of change management and risk mitigation.

Key elements include:

- **Reversion Steps:** Detailed instructions for undoing changes.
- **Trigger Conditions:** Criteria for initiating the backout plan.
- **Testing:** Ensuring the plan works effectively under real-world conditions.

Backout Plans reduce downtime and minimize the impact of failed changes.

# Server message block (SMB)

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork protocol]]

Server message block (SMB) is a network file sharing protocol that allows applications to read and write to files and request services from server programs in a network. It also provides an authenticated inter-process communication mechanism.

- **Port number and protocol type:** SMB operates over port 445 using TCP.
- **File sharing and access:** SMB enables file sharing across a network, allowing users to access and manage files on remote servers as if they were on their local machines.
- **Authentication and security:** SMB supports user authentication, allowing controlled access to shared resources. It also provides encryption options in later versions to secure the communication.
- **Versions:** The protocol has evolved over time with different versions such as SMB 1.0, SMB 2.0, and SMB 3.0, with newer versions offering enhanced performance and security features.
- **Functions:** Besides file sharing, SMB allows printers to be shared over the network and supports other functionalities like named pipes and messaging.

SMB is commonly used in Windows-based networks but is also supported by other operating systems for cross-platform compatibility.

# Certificate authority (CA)

[[üè∑Ô∏èCryptography]]

A Certificate Authority (CA) is a trusted organization or entity responsible for issuing, managing, and verifying digital certificates. These certificates authenticate the identity of entities (such as websites, individuals, or organizations) and enable secure communication over networks, particularly the internet.

A CA issues digital certificates based on a thorough verification process. These certificates are typically used in public key infrastructure (PKI) systems, where they link a public key to the identity of the certificate holder. The CA's role includes validating the legitimacy of the certificate request, signing the certificate with its private key, and revoking certificates when necessary.

CAs play a critical role in establishing trust on the internet. Browsers, email systems, and other software rely on a list of trusted CAs to verify the authenticity of certificates and ensure secure connections, such as in SSL/TLS encryption for websites.

## Private Certificate Authorities (CA)

A Private Certificate Authority (CA) allows an organization to issue and manage its own digital certificates, rather than relying on an external CA. This is especially useful for medium-to-large organizations with many web servers or internal security needs.

For a private CA to function, devices within the organization must trust the internal CA. Tools like Windows Certificate Services or OpenCA help manage and implement this solution.

- Build and manage certificates in-house, with devices trusting the internal CA.
- Ideal for organizations with many web servers or privacy requirements.
- Implement using tools like Windows Certificate Services or OpenCA.

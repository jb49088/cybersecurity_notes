[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

Typo-squatting, also known as URL hijacking, is a cyber attack technique where attackers register domain names that are similar to popular websites but with slight variations, often created by common typographical errors. These fake domains are then used to deceive users into visiting malicious websites, where they may unknowingly provide sensitive information, such as login credentials, personal data, or financial details.

Typo-squatting relies on the assumption that users will make simple typing errors when entering URLs into their browsers, such as swapping letters or forgetting punctuation marks. Attackers take advantage of this by purchasing domains with these mistakes, making them look like legitimate sites to unsuspecting users.

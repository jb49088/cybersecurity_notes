# Responsible disclosure program

A responsible disclosure program is a structured approach to handling the discovery and reporting of security vulnerabilities. It ensures that vulnerabilities are addressed properly before they are made public, minimizing the risk of exploitation.

Key elements of responsible disclosure include:

- **Time to fix:** Vulnerabilities require time to be patched, including software updates, testing, and deployment to ensure a secure solution.
- **Bug bounty programs:** Rewarding individuals for discovering and reporting vulnerabilities, often offering monetary compensation for detailed documentation of the issue.
- **Controlled information release:** The process where researchers report vulnerabilities to the manufacturer or vendor, who then works on a fix before the vulnerability is publicly disclosed to avoid exploitation.

By following a responsible disclosure process, organizations can reduce security risks while encouraging collaboration between security researchers and developers.

# Threat hunting 

Threat hunting is the proactive process of identifying and mitigating cyber threats before they can cause harm. It is a dynamic and evolving effort to stay ahead of attackers in the ever-changing cybersecurity landscape.

- **Find the attacker before they find you:** Threat hunting is a constant game of cat and mouse, requiring vigilance to detect and stop attackers early.
- **Adapt to evolving strategies:** As defenses like firewalls become more robust, attackers refine techniques such as phishing, requiring continuous adjustments to detection methods.
- **Recognize the reactive nature of intelligence data:** Threat intelligence often becomes available only after an attack has occurred, making proactive hunting essential.
- **Speed up reaction time:** Leverage advanced technology, such as automation, machine learning, and behavioral analytics, to detect and respond to threats more quickly.

Threat hunting strengthens an organizationâ€™s defense by actively seeking and neutralizing potential risks, reducing the likelihood of successful attacks.

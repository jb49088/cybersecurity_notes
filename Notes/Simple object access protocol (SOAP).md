[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork protocol]]

Simple object access protocol (SOAP) is a messaging protocol used for exchanging structured data between web services over a network. SOAP enables communication between applications running on different platforms and programming languages by using XML-based messaging.

SOAP is widely used in enterprise environments for secure and reliable web service communication, particularly in scenarios that require strict message validation, transaction support, or integration with legacy systems.

- **XML-based messaging:** Uses XML to format messages, ensuring interoperability across different systems.
- **Protocol independence:** Works over various transport protocols, including HTTP, SMTP, and TCP.
- **Security features:** Supports encryption, authentication, and message integrity through standards like WS-Security.
- **Reliability:** Ensures message delivery with built-in error handling and retry mechanisms.
- **Extensibility:** Allows additional functionality through SOAP headers, enabling advanced features such as transaction management and asynchronous processing.

SOAP is commonly used in enterprise applications, financial services, and government systems where security, reliability, and compliance are critical.

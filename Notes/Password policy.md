[[üè∑Ô∏èPolicy]]

A password policy is a set of rules and guidelines that define how passwords should be created, used, managed, and protected within an organization's IT environment. The primary goal of a password policy is to enhance security by promoting strong, unique passwords and reducing the risk of unauthorized access to systems, networks, and data. To discourage malicious actors, a password policy usually states that a user will lose access to the network after entering the wrong password a certain number of times in a row.

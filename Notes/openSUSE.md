- **Leap vs. Tumbleweed**: Leap is based on SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) and offers long-term support, while Tumbleweed provides continuously updated software with a rolling-release model.
- **YaST system management**: openSUSE includes **YaST (Yet another Setup Tool)**, a powerful configuration tool for managing system settings, software, networking, and security.
- **Zypper package manager**: openSUSE uses `zypper` for package management, providing a robust alternative to `apt` or `dnf`.
- **Strong security focus**: Features like AppArmor, system snapshots, and transactional updates enhance security and reliability.
- **Support for multiple desktop environments**: Users can choose from KDE Plasma, GNOME, Xfce, and more during installation.
- **Enterprise-level stability**: Leap benefits from SUSE Linux Enterprise code, making it a strong choice for production environments.

openSUSE is a versatile Linux distribution suitable for developers, system administrators, and enterprise users looking for either a stable or cutting-edge Linux experience.

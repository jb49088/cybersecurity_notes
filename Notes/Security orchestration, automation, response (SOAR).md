# Security orchestration, automation, response (SOAR)

Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) is a set of technologies and processes that enable organizations to streamline and automate security operations. SOAR platforms integrate multiple security tools, workflows, and data sources to improve response times, reduce manual effort, and enhance overall security efficiency.

- **Orchestration**: SOAR platforms integrate various security tools, such as firewalls, endpoint detection systems, and threat intelligence platforms, to create a unified workflow for security teams. This enables better coordination across different tools and teams.
- **Automation**: SOAR automates routine and repetitive tasks, such as alert triage, incident analysis, and even response actions. This reduces the time spent on manual processes and accelerates the incident response lifecycle.
- **Response**: SOAR helps automate the execution of predefined response actions, such as isolating infected devices, blocking malicious IPs, or updating firewall rules, to contain threats quickly and efficiently.
- **Incident management**: SOAR platforms provide centralized dashboards for tracking and managing security incidents. This improves visibility, helps prioritize threats, and ensures a consistent, coordinated response across security teams.
- **Integration with other tools**: SOAR platforms are designed to work alongside existing security tools, such as SIEMs, EDR systems, and threat intelligence platforms, to enhance their effectiveness and create a cohesive security infrastructure.

By combining orchestration, automation, and response, SOAR platforms significantly reduce the time to detect, respond to, and mitigate security threats, allowing organizations to stay ahead of potential attacks.

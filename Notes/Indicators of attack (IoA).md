# Indicators of attack (IoA)

**Indicators of attack** (**IoA**) are the series of observed events that indicate a real-time incident.Â  IoAs focus on identifying the behavioral evidence of an attacker, including their methods and intentions.

Essentially, IoAs focus on finding the why and how of an ongoing or unknown attack. For example, observing a process that makes a network connection is an example of an IoA.

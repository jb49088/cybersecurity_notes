# Risk tolerance

Risk tolerance is the specific level of risk an organization is prepared to accept within its risk appetite. It refers to the maximum amount of risk that an organization is willing to endure in a particular area or situation, considering the potential impact on operations, reputation, or finances. While risk appetite is broad, risk tolerance is more granular and can vary across different risk categories.

Key elements of risk tolerance:

- **Thresholds**: It sets clear limits on the acceptable level of risk for different activities, processes, or projects.
- **Context-specific**: Risk tolerance varies based on factors such as business unit, industry, regulatory requirements, or specific strategic goals.
- **Impact and likelihood**: Risk tolerance takes into account both the potential severity of the impact and the likelihood of the risk occurring.

Understanding risk tolerance helps organizations make decisions that align with their capacity to handle specific risks, preventing overexposure to unwanted uncertainties.

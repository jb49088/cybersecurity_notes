# Microservice architecture

Microservice architecture is a software design model that breaks an application into a collection of smaller, independent services. Each microservice handles a specific function and communicates with others through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which act as the "glue" binding the services together into a cohesive application.

This architecture offers scalability by allowing individual services to be scaled independently based on demand. It enhances resilience by containing outages to specific services without affecting the entire application. Additionally, security and compliance are improved through the built-in containment of services, isolating risks and simplifying adherence to regulatory requirements.

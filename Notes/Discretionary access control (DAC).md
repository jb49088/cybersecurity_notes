[[üè∑Ô∏èAccess control model]]

Discretionary access control (DAC) is a common access control model used in most operating systems, where the owner of a resource determines access permissions. This model provides flexibility but is less secure compared to other access control methods.

- **Owner-defined access:** The creator of a resource (e.g., a file or spreadsheet) has full control over who can access it and can modify these permissions at any time.
- **Flexibility:** Permissions can be customized on a per-user basis, making it easy to share resources as needed.
- **Familiar model:** DAC is widely used and intuitive for end-users, as it's based on common practices like sharing files and folders.
- **Security weaknesses:** Its flexibility makes DAC more susceptible to security breaches, such as accidental permission misconfigurations or malicious user actions.

Discretionary access control is best suited for environments where ease of use and flexibility are prioritized over stringent security measures.

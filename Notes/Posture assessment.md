# Posture assessment

Posture assessment is a security process that ensures devices connecting to a network are properly configured and compliant with security standards. This is particularly important in environments with diverse devices, such as Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) scenarios, where personal devices may introduce security risks.

- **Assess device trustworthiness:** Not all devices are equally secure. Posture assessment checks whether devices are properly secured before granting them access to the network.
- **Monitor potential security risks:** Devices may be vulnerable due to malware infections, missing anti-malware software, or the presence of unauthorized applications. The posture assessment process aims to detect and address these risks before they can compromise the network.
- **Health check before network connection:** Prior to granting network access, devices undergo a health check to evaluate their security posture, ensuring they meet organizational security requirements.
- **Verify antivirus protection:** The assessment confirms whether the device is running up-to-date antivirus software, ensuring it is protected against known threats.
- **Check for corporate applications:** Devices must have the necessary corporate applications installed to ensure they align with the organization's security policies and operational needs.
- **Mobile device security:** For mobile devices, additional checks like disk encryption are performed to safeguard sensitive data in case the device is lost or stolen.
- **Device type agnostic:** The assessment applies to all types of devices, whether they are running Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, or Android, ensuring comprehensive security coverage across a diverse device landscape.

Posture assessment is essential for managing device security in an environment where users have control over their devices. By evaluating device health and security status before network access, organizations can reduce the risk of malware infections and unauthorized access.

# Identity and access management (IAM)

Identity and access management (IAM) is a framework of policies and technologies that ensures the right individuals and entities have appropriate access to resources while maintaining security and compliance.

- **Provides access across platforms:** Manages access to applications on desktops, browsers, mobile devices, and other platforms.
- **Supports distributed data storage:** Controls access to data in cloud environments, private data centers, and other locations.
- **Manages diverse user groups:** Handles access for employees, vendors, contractors, and customers across various systems.
- **Implements role-based permissions:** Ensures individuals and entities receive the correct permissions based on their roles, preventing unauthorized access.
- **Enables identity lifecycle management:** Assigns and manages a digital identity for every user or entity, including humans and non-human systems.
- **Enforces access control:** Limits access to only the resources necessary for a user's or entity's role.
- **Authenticates and authorizes entities:** Verifies that users and entities are who they claim to be before granting access.
- **Incorporates identity governance:** Tracks resource access for users and entities, often to meet regulatory requirements.

IAM is essential for securing modern IT environments, supporting operational efficiency, and maintaining compliance with industry regulations.

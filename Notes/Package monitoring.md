# Package monitoring

Package monitoring involves verifying the integrity and security of software packages, particularly those distributed as part of open-source projects or external supply chains. Ensuring package legitimacy is essential to maintaining supply chain security and preventing the introduction of vulnerabilities.

Key aspects of package monitoring include:

- Confirming the package is legitimate by ensuring it originates from a trusted source, contains no malware, and has no embedded vulnerabilities.
- Verifying the package contents before deployment to confirm they are safe and meet the intended purpose without introducing security risks.

By implementing package monitoring, organizations can maintain supply chain integrity and deploy secure, reliable software.

# Attack vector

An attack vector is a method or pathway used by cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access to a system or network, exploit vulnerabilities, or launch malicious activities. Attack vectors can take many forms, including technical, social, or physical methods that allow the attacker to bypass security measures and reach the target.

## Message-based vectors

Message-based vectors involve using communication methods to deceive users into taking actions that compromise security. These attacks often exploit human behavior, such as curiosity or urgency.

- **Phishing**: Deceptive emails or messages to steal credentials.
- **Malware Delivery**: Malicious attachments or links.
- **Social Engineering**: Manipulating users into revealing sensitive information.

## Image-based vectors

These attacks hide malicious code within image files or formats to exploit system vulnerabilities. Identifying threats in images can be difficult, as they often appear harmless.

- **Threat in Image Formats**: SVG files containing executable code.
- **HTML/JS Injection**: Embedded malicious code in images.
- **Input Validation**: Exploiting improper input validation in browsers.

## File-based vectors

Malicious code can be embedded in files, which trigger harmful actions when opened. These files often appear legitimate, making detection harder.

- **Non-executable Files**: Malware hidden in PDFs, ZIPs, etc.
- **PDFs**: Containing embedded scripts.
- **Microsoft Office Files**: Leveraging macros or add-ins for malware.

## Voice call vectors

Voice-based attacks use phone calls or VoIP systems to deceive individuals and compromise security. Attackers often impersonate trusted entities to gather sensitive data.

- **Vishing**: Phishing via phone calls.
- **Robocalls**: Automated scam calls.
- **Call Tampering**: Manipulating or disrupting phone conversations.

## Removable device vectors

Attackers exploit removable devices like USB drives to bypass network security and deliver malware or steal data. These devices can introduce threats to otherwise secure environments.

- **Bypassing Firewalls**: Malware delivered via USB.
- **USB Keyboards**: Injecting malicious commands.
- **Data Exfiltration**: Stealing data without triggering network alerts.

## Vulnerable software vectors

Exploiting weaknesses in software to gain unauthorized access to systems or data. These vulnerabilities can exist in both client and server-side applications.

- **Client-based**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in installed software.
- **Server-side**: Attacking compromised servers affecting all clients.
- **Unpatched Software**: Exploiting known software flaws.

## Unsupported systems vectors

Systems no longer receiving updates or support from manufacturers are vulnerable to cyberattacks. These outdated systems lack the latest security patches, making them easy targets.

- **Outdated OS**: No longer supported by the manufacturer.
- **Single Vulnerable System**: One outdated device exposing the network.
- **Lack of Patches**: Leaving systems exposed to new threats.

## Unsecure network vectors

Unsecured networks allow attackers to intercept or access data. Weak encryption and outdated protocols can make networks easy targets for exploitation.

- **Unencrypted Data**: Data intercepted during transmission.
- **Weak Wireless Security**: Exploiting WEP or WPA vulnerabilities.
- **Bluetooth**: Attacks via unprotected Bluetooth devices.

## Open service ports

Exposed service ports provide entry points for attackers to exploit system vulnerabilities. Misconfigured or unnecessary open ports increase the risk of unauthorized access.

- **Exposed Ports**: Open ports that attackers can exploit.
- **Misconfigured Services**: Improper settings in services running on open ports.
- **Firewall Gaps**: Weak firewall rules allowing unauthorized access.

## Default credentials

Devices with default usernames and passwords are often exploited because they are easily accessible online. Failing to change these credentials can lead to full system compromise.

- **Administrator Access**: Default credentials give full system control.
- **Publicly Available**: Default login information easily found online.
- **Router Vulnerability**: Unchanged default credentials on network devices.

## Supply chain vectors

Supply chain attacks target vulnerabilities in the production and delivery processes. Attackers can compromise hardware, software, or services before they reach the final user.

- **Tampered Infrastructure**: Malicious code embedded during manufacturing.
- **Vendor Compromise**: Attacking trusted suppliers to gain access.
- **Counterfeit Products**: Fake or compromised products leading to vulnerabilities.

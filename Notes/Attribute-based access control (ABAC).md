# Attribute-based access control (ABAC)

[[üè∑Ô∏èAccess control model]]

Attribute-based access control (ABAC) evaluates multiple attributes to determine access, enabling granular and context-aware authorization decisions.

- **Supports complex relationships:** Access is granted based on intricate user relationships with applications and data.
- **Uses multiple evaluation criteria:** Decisions can consider parameters such as resource type, IP address, time of access, user role, or action requested.
- **Context-aware model:** Takes environmental factors and relationships into account, enhancing decision-making.
- **Next-generation authorization:** Extends traditional access control models by incorporating dynamic and situational attributes.
- **Flexible and secure:** Allows precise control over who can access what, when, and why.

Attribute-based access control's dynamic nature is ideal for environments requiring fine-grained access control and adaptability to evolving security needs.

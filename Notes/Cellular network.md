# Cellular network

Cellular networks provide wireless communication by dividing geographical areas into smaller "cells," each served by its own antenna that transmits and receives signals within a specific frequency range. These networks enable mobile devices, such as smartphones, to communicate over long distances, supporting technologies like 4G and 5G, which offer high-speed internet and voice services.

Each cell in the network is designed to manage a set of frequencies to ensure that communication within the cell is clear and efficient, while preventing interference with adjacent cells. This cellular system allows mobile devices to seamlessly transition from one cell to another as users move, ensuring continuous connectivity.

However, there are security concerns related to cellular networks. These include the monitoring of traffic, which could expose sensitive data, as well as location tracking, which can be used to track the movements of a device and its user. Additionally, mobile devices are accessible worldwide, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access or malicious attacks, especially when roaming across different regions and networks.

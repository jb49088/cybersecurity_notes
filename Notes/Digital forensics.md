# Digital forensics

Digital forensics involves the collection, preservation, and analysis of data to investigate cyber incidents. It plays a key role in understanding intrusions and supporting legal or regulatory actions.

- **Collect and protect information related to an intrusion:** Gather data from various sources, ensuring proper protection to maintain its integrity during the investigation.
- **Follow RFC 3227 guidelines:** RFC 3227 outlines best practices for evidence collection and archiving, providing a standardized approach for handling digital evidence.
- **Standard digital forensic process:** The process typically includes three main stages: acquisition, analysis, and reporting of evidence to ensure a thorough investigation.
- **Detail-oriented approach:** Digital forensics requires meticulous attention to detail. Take extensive notes and document every step to preserve the chain of custody and support legal proceedings.

Digital forensics is critical for uncovering the full scope of an incident and ensuring that evidence is handled correctly for potential legal action.

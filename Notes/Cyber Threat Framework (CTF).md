# Cyber Threat Framework (CTF)

[[üè∑Ô∏èFramework]]

The Cyber Threat Framework, developed by the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), provides a standardized way to describe and analyze cyber threat activities. It helps organizations understand, categorize, and communicate cyber threats consistently, enabling more effective threat information sharing and collaborative defense efforts.

**The framework is structured into four high-level categories:**

1. **Preparation:** Activities conducted by adversaries to prepare for attacks and identify potential targets.
	- **Reconnaissance:** Gathering information about potential targets, such as their systems, networks, and personnel.
	- **Weaponization:** Developing or obtaining the tools and capabilities needed for an attack, such as malware or exploit kits.
	- **Infrastructure Development:** Setting up the infrastructure needed for the attack, such as command-and-control servers and proxy networks.

2. **Engagement:** Initial contact and interactions with the target to gain access and establish a foothold.
	- **Delivery:** Transmitting the malicious payload to the target, often through phishing emails, drive-by downloads, or direct exploitation of vulnerabilities.
	- **Exploitation:** Taking advantage of a vulnerability to execute malicious code on the target system.
	- **Installation:** Installing malware or establishing backdoors to maintain access to the target system.

3. **Presence:** Maintaining and expanding access within the target environment.
	- **Command and Control (C2):** Establishing communication channels with compromised systems to control them remotely.
	- **Lateral Movement:** Moving through the target network to compromise additional systems and elevate privileges.
	- **Persistence:** Implementing measures to maintain long-term access to the target environment, even after reboots or detection.

4. **Effect/Consequence:** Achieving the adversary‚Äôs objectives, which can vary widely depending on their motives.
	- **Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data from the target environment.
	- **Impact:** Disrupting, degrading, or destroying target systems or data, often through techniques like ransomware, data wiping, or denial-of-service attacks.
	- **Execution:** Carrying out specific commands or actions to achieve the intended effect on the target.

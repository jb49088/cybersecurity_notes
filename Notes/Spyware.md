[[üè∑Ô∏èMalware]] 

Spyware is a type of malicious software designed to secretly monitor and collect information about a user's activities without their knowledge or consent. Unlike adware, which primarily focuses on displaying unwanted ads, spyware is focused on stealing sensitive data, tracking browsing habits, or even gaining unauthorized access to personal information like passwords, financial data, or private communications.

Spyware can be difficult to detect, as it often operates in the background, using minimal system resources to avoid detection. Its main goal is typically data theft, surveillance, or exploitation, and it can be delivered through infected websites, email attachments, or bundled with other software.

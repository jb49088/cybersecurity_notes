# Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

[[üè∑Ô∏èRegulation]]

HIPAA is a U.S. law that requires the protection of sensitive patient health information. HIPAA prohibits the disclosure of a person's medical information without their knowledge and consent.

Organizations that store patient data have a legal obligation to inform patients of a breach because if a patients' [[Protected health information (PHI)|PHI]] is exposed, it can lead to identity theft and insurance fraud. 

Along with understanding HIPAA as a law, security professionals also need to be familiar with [[Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST)|HITRUST]], which is a security framework and assurance program that helps institutions meet HIPAA compliance.

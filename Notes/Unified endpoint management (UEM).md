# Unified endpoint management (UEM)

Unified endpoint management (UEM) is a comprehensive approach to managing and securing a wide range of devices used in an organization, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops, and IoT devices. UEM combines mobile device management (MDM), enterprise mobility management (EMM), and other endpoint management tools into a single platform to provide centralized control, security, and monitoring across all endpoints.

- **Centralized management:** Offers a unified console to manage all devices, regardless of type or operating system.
- **Security enforcement:** Applies security policies like encryption, authentication, and remote wipe to protect sensitive data across all endpoints.
- **Device lifecycle management:** Covers all stages from device provisioning and configuration to monitoring, updates, and decommissioning.
- **Support for diverse platforms:** Manages a variety of devices and operating systems, including iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and more.
- **Application and content management:** Ensures that the right apps and content are deployed and accessible to authorized users while preventing unauthorized access.

UEM enables organizations to streamline device management, enhance security, and improve operational efficiency in an increasingly mobile and diverse computing environment.

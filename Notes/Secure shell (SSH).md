[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork protocol]]

Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol used to securely access and manage remote systems over an unsecured network. It is widely used for securely logging into remote machines, executing commands, and transferring files.

- **Port number:** SSH typically operates over port 22 for both remote login and file transfer.
- **Protocol type:** SSH uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for reliable and secure communication.
- **Authentication:** SSH uses public-key cryptography for authentication, where users can authenticate via passwords or SSH keys for enhanced security.
- **Encryption:** SSH encrypts the communication between the client and server, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.
- **Secure file transfer:** SSH supports secure file transfers through protocols like SFTP and SCP, both of which operate over the same encrypted SSH connection.
- **Remote command execution:** SSH allows users to execute commands remotely, making it essential for system administration and automation tasks.
- **Port forwarding:** SSH supports tunneling or port forwarding, enabling secure connections for other protocols and applications.

SSH is a fundamental tool for secure remote administration and file transfer in both private and enterprise networks.

# Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork type]]

For those networks that are larger than a LAN but confined to a relatively small geographical area, there is the term metropolitan area network (MAN). A MAN is generally defined as a network that spans a city or a large campus. For example, if a city decides to install wireless hotspots in various places, that network could be considered a MAN.

One of the questions a lot of people ask is, ‚ÄúIs there really a difference between a MAN and a WAN?‚Äù There is definitely some gray area here; in many cases they are virtually identical. Perhaps the biggest difference is who has responsibility for managing the connectivity. In a MAN, a central IT organization, such as the campus or city IT staff, is responsible. In a WAN, it‚Äôs implied that you will be using publicly available communication lines, and there will be a phone company or other service provider involved.

- **Templates and themes:** CMS platforms often offer customizable templates and themes for designing consistent and professional-looking websites.
- **User roles and permissions:** They support multiple users with different access levels, enabling collaboration while maintaining control over who can make changes.
- **Scalability:** A CMS can accommodate growing content needs, from small blogs to large-scale enterprise websites.
- **Plugins and integrations:** Many CMS platforms support plugins and third-party integrations to extend functionality, such as SEO tools, analytics, and e-commerce features.

[[🏷️Policy]]

A remote access policy is a set of rules and guidelines that define how employees, contractors, and third-party vendors can remotely connect to an organization's internal network, systems, and resources. The primary objective of a remote access policy is to ensure secure and controlled access to corporate networks and data while maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

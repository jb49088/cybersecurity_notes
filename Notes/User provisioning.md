# User provisioning

User provisioning is the process of creating, managing, and removing user accounts in an IT environment. It ensures users have appropriate access to resources based on their roles and responsibilities.

- **Handles account creation and removal:** Manages the lifecycle of user accounts, including setup and deactivation.
- **Aligns with organizational events:** Updates accounts for events like hiring, transfers, promotions, and job separation.
- **Defines account attributes:** Configures user details, such as name, roles, group memberships, and permissions.
- **Supports Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Acts as a critical step in controlling access and enforcing security policies.
- **Restricts elevated access:** Ensures new accounts are not granted administrative privileges by default.

Effective user provisioning is essential for maintaining security, streamlining account management, and ensuring compliance with access control policies.

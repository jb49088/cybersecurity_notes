[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork security]]

A secure web gateway (SWG) is a security solution that protects users from online threats by filtering web traffic, enforcing security policies, and preventing access to malicious content. SWGs act as an intermediary between users and the internet, ensuring that web requests comply with security rules before granting access.

SWGs are commonly used in enterprise environments to prevent cyber threats such as malware, phishing, and data leaks while maintaining compliance with organizational security policies.

- **Web traffic filtering:** Blocks access to malicious, suspicious, or non-compliant websites based on predefined security policies.
- **Malware protection:** Detects and prevents the download of malware, ransomware, and other cyber threats from infected websites.
- **Data loss prevention (DLP):** Monitors and restricts the transfer of sensitive data to prevent leaks and unauthorized sharing.
- **Content inspection:** Scans web content, including encrypted HTTPS traffic, to identify and mitigate potential risks.
- **User access control:** Enforces authentication and authorization policies to restrict web access based on user roles and permissions.

Secure web gateways help organizations maintain a safe browsing environment by preventing web-based threats and ensuring compliance with security policies.

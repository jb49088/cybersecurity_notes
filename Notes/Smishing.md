[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

Smishing is a type of social engineering attack where cybercriminals use text messages (SMS) to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or other personal data. The term "smishing" is a combination of "SMS" (Short Message Service) and "phishing." In smishing attacks, attackers may impersonate trusted entities, such as banks, government agencies, or popular service providers, in order to trick victims into clicking malicious links, downloading harmful attachments, or responding with sensitive information.

Smishing messages often contain urgent or alarming language to pressure the victim into taking immediate action. For example, they may claim that a bank account has been compromised or that a prize is waiting to be claimed, prompting the recipient to provide personal details or click on a malicious link.

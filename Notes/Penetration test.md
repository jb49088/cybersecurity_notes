# Penetration test

A penetration test (pentest) simulates a cyberattack to identify and exploit vulnerabilities within a system, network, or application. Unlike vulnerability scanning, which only identifies weaknesses, a pentest actively attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities to assess the real-world risk they pose.

- **Simulated attacks:** Pentests mimic actual cyberattacks to assess system weaknesses and determine potential damage from a breach.
- **Beyond vulnerability scanning:** While scanning identifies vulnerabilities, penetration testing goes further by attempting to exploit those weaknesses.
- **Compliance mandate:** Many organizations are required to conduct regular penetration tests, often by third-party providers, as part of regulatory compliance or industry best practices.

Penetration testing is an essential component of a comprehensive security strategy, providing valuable insights into how systems might be breached and what actions can be taken to strengthen defenses.

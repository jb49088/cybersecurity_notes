# Standard error

An error message returned by the [[Operating system (OS)|OS]] through the [[Shell|shell]]. Sometimes this might occur when we misspell a command or the system doesn't know the response to the command. Other times, it might happen because we don't have the appropriate permissions to perform a command.

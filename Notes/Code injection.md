[[üè∑Ô∏èInjection attack]]

Code injection is a technique where an attacker adds malicious code into a data stream or application. This often happens due to improper handling of user input and output by the application.

When an application doesn't validate or sanitize input correctly, attackers can inject harmful code that the system executes. These vulnerabilities can exist in various data types, including HTML, SQL, XML, LDAP, and others. Proper input validation and secure coding practices are critical to preventing code injection attacks.

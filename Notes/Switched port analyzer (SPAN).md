# Switched port analyzer (SPAN)

Switched port analyzer (SPAN) is a feature found in network switches that allows for the monitoring of network traffic. It enables the duplication (or mirroring) of network traffic from one or more ports to another port, where it can be analyzed without affecting the original traffic flow. SPAN is typically used for network monitoring, performance analysis, and troubleshooting.

- **Traffic monitoring**: Allows network administrators to monitor real-time traffic for analysis without impacting the live network.
- **Troubleshooting**: SPAN can be used to capture traffic related to specific issues or events for detailed analysis, helping to pinpoint network problems.
- **Security analysis**: Security teams can use SPAN to capture traffic for intrusion detection or other security monitoring tools to identify potential threats.

SPAN can be configured to monitor a single port (ingress or egress) or a range of ports, and it is widely used in environments that require detailed traffic inspection, such as data centers or enterprise networks.

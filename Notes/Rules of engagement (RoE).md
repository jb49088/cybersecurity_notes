# Rules of engagement (RoE)

The rules of engagement (RoE) is a critical document that outlines the parameters and guidelines for a penetration test or security assessment. It ensures all parties involved understand the scope, purpose, and boundaries of the test, minimizing risks and maximizing effectiveness.

- **Purpose and scope:** Defines the goal of the test and what is to be tested, making all parties aware of the test boundaries.
- **Type of testing and schedule:** Specifies whether the test will be a physical breach, internal, or external test and the timing, such as normal working hours or after hours.
- **Rules and guidelines:** Includes specifics like allowed IP address ranges, emergency contacts, handling sensitive information, and identifying in-scope and out-of-scope devices or applications.

By clearly outlining these parameters, the RoE helps ensure that the test is conducted safely, efficiently, and in compliance with legal and ethical standards.

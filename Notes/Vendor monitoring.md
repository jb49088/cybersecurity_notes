# Vendor monitoring

Vendor monitoring involves the continuous management and evaluation of vendor relationships to ensure that they meet contractual obligations and align with organizational standards. Effective vendor monitoring helps mitigate risks, maintain service quality, and adapt to changes over time.

- **Ongoing management of the vendor relationship:** Monitoring doesn’t end when the contract is signed. It is an ongoing process to ensure compliance and performance.
- **Regular reviews:** Conduct periodic reviews to assess the vendor’s financial health, IT security practices, and reputation. This may include evaluating news articles, social media posts, and other public information.
- **Custom indicators for different vendors:** Each vendor may be monitored using tailored metrics, combining both quantitative and qualitative analyses, depending on their role and significance.
- **Dedicated relationship manager:** Assign a specific person to oversee the vendor relationship. This individual will be responsible for coordinating the monitoring process and addressing any issues that arise.

By implementing structured vendor monitoring practices, organizations can ensure that vendor relationships remain beneficial, secure, and aligned with their strategic goals.

# Secure Hash Algorithm 2 (SHA-2)

[[üè∑Ô∏èHash function]]

Secure Hash Algorithm 2 (SHA-2) is a family of cryptographic hash functions designed by the NSA and standardized by NIST in 2002. It includes several variants, such as SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512, which differ in their output lengths and security levels.

SHA-2 addresses the vulnerabilities of SHA-1, offering improved resistance to collision and preimage attacks. It is widely used in digital signatures, certificates, blockchain technologies, and secure communication protocols like TLS.

Due to its strong security properties, SHA-2 remains a cornerstone of modern cryptographic systems.

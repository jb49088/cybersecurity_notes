# Hierarchical Database

A hierarchical database is a type of database model that organizes data in a tree-like structure, where each record has a single parent and potentially many children. This structure resembles a hierarchy, where data is arranged in a parent-child relationship, with each parent node linking to one or more child nodes, forming a hierarchy of records. This model is especially useful for representing hierarchical relationships, such as organizational structures or file systems.

In a hierarchical database, data is stored in records, and these records are linked together by pointers, with the parent record pointing to its child records. The model is simple and efficient for certain types of data, particularly when the relationships between records are naturally hierarchical.

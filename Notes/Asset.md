An asset refers to any resource, item, or component that holds value to an organization. In IT and cybersecurity, assets typically include hardware, software, data, networks, and systems that are critical for operations. Proper identification and management of assets are essential for ensuring security, efficiency, and compliance.

Assets are generally categorized into:

- **Hardware Assets:** Physical devices like servers, computers, routers, and IoT devices.
- **Software Assets:** Applications, operating systems, and licenses.
- **Data Assets:** Information such as databases, intellectual property, and user records.
- **Network Assets:** Network infrastructure, such as firewalls, switches, and access points.

Assets are often tracked through asset inventories, helping organizations maintain visibility, manage risk, and protect critical resources.

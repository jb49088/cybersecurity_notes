# Separation of duties (SoD)

[[🏷️Principle]]

Separation of duties is a security principle that distributes tasks and privileges among multiple individuals to prevent one person from having complete control over critical functions. This practice reduces the risk of errors, fraud, and malicious activities by requiring cooperation among team members to accomplish sensitive tasks.

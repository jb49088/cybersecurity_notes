# Plain old telephone service (POTS)

Plain old telephone service (POTS) refers to the traditional analog telephone system that has been in use since the late 19th century. It operates over copper wire infrastructure and provides **basic voice communication** using circuit-switched technology.

- **Analog technology:** Uses a **dedicated circuit** for each call, ensuring consistent voice quality.
- **Power independence:** Unlike modern VoIP systems, POTS lines **work during power outages**, as they are powered by the telephone exchange.
- **Limited bandwidth:** Primarily designed for **voice transmission**, with a frequency range of **300 Hz to 3.4 kHz**, though it has been used for fax machines and dial-up internet.
- **Reliable but outdated:** While POTS is known for its reliability, it is increasingly being replaced by **VoIP (Voice over IP)** and cellular networks.
- **Regulated service:** Often subject to government regulations to ensure **universal access and emergency service availability**.

POTS remains in use for critical infrastructure, including **alarm systems, elevator emergency lines, and rural areas** where digital alternatives are not yet available.

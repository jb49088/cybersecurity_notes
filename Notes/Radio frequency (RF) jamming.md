[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork attack]]

Radio frequency (RF) jamming is a deliberate act of disrupting wireless communication by transmitting interfering signals that prevent devices from receiving or interpreting legitimate signals. This attack is a form of Denial of Service (DoS) targeting wireless networks.

RF jamming works by decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiving device, making it unable to distinguish the valid signal from the interference. Common methods include broadcasting high-power signals on the same frequency or using modulated signals to overwhelm the network.

While RF jamming is intentional and malicious, interference from sources like microwave ovens or fluorescent lights can cause similar effects unintentionally. Unlike interference, jamming is deliberate, aimed at rendering a wireless network unusable.

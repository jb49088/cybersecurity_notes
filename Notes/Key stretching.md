# Key stretching

Key stretching is a cryptographic technique used to enhance the security of weak keys, such as those generated by users in password-based systems. It involves taking a short or simple cryptographic key (such as a password) and applying an algorithm to increase its length and complexity, making it harder for attackers to break the key using brute force methods.

At its core, key stretching is used to mitigate the vulnerability of short, easy-to-guess passwords by making the process of cracking them more time-consuming and computationally expensive. By increasing the number of iterations a key undergoes during hashing, key stretching makes it more difficult for attackers to reverse-engineer the key, even if they have access to hashed values.

Common key stretching algorithms include **PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2)**, **bcrypt**, and **scrypt**. These algorithms apply multiple rounds of hashing combined with a salt to strengthen the original key. The use of a salt ensures that even if two users have the same password, their hashed keys will be different.

Key stretching is widely used in password storage systems to ensure that even if a password is weak or common, it is not easily cracked by attackers using methods like dictionary attacks or rainbow tables.

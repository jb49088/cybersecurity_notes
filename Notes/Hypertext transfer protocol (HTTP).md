# Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork protocol]]

Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol used for transferring hypertext (web pages) and other resources on the World Wide Web. It defines the rules for requesting and delivering web content between clients (typically browsers) and servers.

- **Port number and protocol type:** HTTP operates over port 80 using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for reliable data transfer.
- **Request/response model:** HTTP is based on a request-response model, where a client sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server responds with the requested data or an error message.
- **Methods:** HTTP supports several request methods such as GET (retrieve data), POST (submit data), PUT (update data), DELETE (remove data), and others, each serving specific functions.
- **Stateless:** HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning each request is independent, and the server does not retain information about previous requests unless session management (cookies, sessions) is used.
- **HTTPS (secure HTTP):** For secure communication, HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is used, which operates over port **443** and adds encryption via SSL/TLS to protect data privacy and integrity.

HTTP is the foundation of web browsing, enabling the retrieval and display of content across the internet.

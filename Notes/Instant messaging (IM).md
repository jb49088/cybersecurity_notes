Instant messaging (IM) is a real-time communication method that allows individuals or groups to send text-based messages over the internet. IM provides a fast, direct, and convenient way to communicate, often used for both personal and business communication.

- **Real-time communication:** IM enables users to send and receive messages instantly, allowing for dynamic and immediate conversations.
- **Text and multimedia support:** In addition to text, modern IM platforms allow users to share multimedia content, including images, videos, voice messages, and files, enriching the communication experience.
- **Presence indication:** IM systems typically include a "presence" feature, indicating whether a user is online, away, or offline, helping others determine the best time to communicate.
- **Group chats:** IM platforms often support group chats, allowing multiple users to communicate simultaneously in a shared conversation, enhancing collaboration and teamwork.
- **Encryption and security:** Many IM platforms offer encryption to protect messages from unauthorized access, ensuring that sensitive or personal communication remains private.

IM is commonly used for informal chats, customer service interactions, and internal team collaboration in professional settings, providing a quick and efficient way to exchange information.

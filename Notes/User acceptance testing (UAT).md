# User acceptance testing (UAT)

User acceptance testing (UAT) is the final phase of the software testing process, where end users validate whether a system meets business requirements and is ready for deployment. UAT ensures that the software functions as intended in real-world scenarios before it is officially released.

- **End-user validation:** Conducted by actual users to confirm the system meets business needs.
- **Real-world testing:** Uses real or simulated data to verify that the application performs correctly in practical use cases.
- **Final approval before deployment:** Ensures that the software is ready for production by identifying any last-minute issues.
- **Focus on business requirements:** Tests whether the system aligns with operational needs rather than just technical functionality.
- **Defect identification and resolution:** Any issues discovered are documented and addressed before the system goes live.

UAT is a critical step in software development, ensuring that applications are user-friendly, functional, and aligned with business goals before they are deployed.

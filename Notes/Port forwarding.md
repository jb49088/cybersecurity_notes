# Port forwarding

Port forwarding is a network configuration technique that allows external devices to access specific services or applications within a private local area network (LAN). It works by mapping an external port on a router or firewall to an internal IP address and port of a device within the network. This enables incoming traffic from the internet to be directed to the correct device on the local network, such as a web server, game server, or CCTV camera.

In port forwarding, when a device sends traffic to the router's external IP address on a specified port, the router forwards that traffic to a corresponding internal IP address and port. This allows remote users to access the desired service inside the network, even if the network is behind a firewall or uses private IP addresses.

Port forwarding is often used in situations where a specific service or application needs to be accessible from outside the local network. Common examples include hosting online games, running web servers, or enabling remote desktop access.

However, since port forwarding opens specific ports to the internet, it can expose the network to potential security risks if not properly managed. It's essential to ensure that only necessary ports are forwarded, and appropriate security measures (such as firewalls and strong authentication) are in place to protect the internal network.

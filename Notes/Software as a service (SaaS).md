# Software as a service (SaaS)

Software as a service (SaaS) is a cloud computing model in which software applications are delivered over the internet as a service. Instead of installing and maintaining software on local machines or servers, users access the software through a web browser. This eliminates the need for organizations or individuals to worry about installation, maintenance, updates, and infrastructure management.

SaaS providers host the application, manage the softwareâ€™s functionality, and ensure its availability, scalability, and security. This model allows users to pay for the software on a subscription basis, often with different tiers based on features, users, or usage levels.

Key benefits of SaaS:

- **Accessibility:** Available from any device with internet access, providing flexibility and mobility.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces the need for hardware, software installation, and maintenance.
- **Automatic Updates:** Software is updated regularly by the provider, ensuring users always have the latest version and security patches.
- **Scalability:** SaaS applications can easily scale to accommodate growing needs without the need for additional infrastructure.

Popular SaaS examples include Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), Microsoft Office 365, Dropbox, and Salesforce, which provide everything from email and document editing to customer relationship management (CRM) and business analytics.

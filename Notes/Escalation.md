# Escalation

Incident escalation is the process of increasing the severity level or priority of a security incident within an organization's incident response framework, typically based on predefined criteria or guidelines.

- **Trigger Points**: These are predefined criteria or thresholds that determine when an incident should be escalated. Trigger points can be based on factors such as impact severity, potential for further harm, complexity, or stakeholder requirements.
	- 
- **Escalation Levels**: Incidents are typically escalated through a series of predefined levels or tiers. Each level represents an increase in the authority, expertise, or resources allocated to manage the incident effectively.
	- 
- **Escalation Pathways**: Organizations establish clear pathways or procedures for escalating incidents. This includes specifying whom to notify or involve at each escalation level, ensuring timely communication and action.
	- 
- **Communication Protocols**: Effective communication is critical during incident escalation to ensure all stakeholders are informed promptly and accurately. This may involve using specific channels (e.g., phone calls, emails, dedicated incident management tools) and adhering to escalation timelines.
	- 
- **Resolution and Review**: As incidents progress through escalation levels, continuous evaluation and reevaluation occur to determine if additional escalation or de-escalation is necessary based on changing circumstances or successful resolution.
	- 
- **Documentation and Learning**: Post-incident, documenting the escalation process and outcomes helps in analyzing response effectiveness and identifying areas for improvement. Lessons learned can be incorporated into future incident response plans.

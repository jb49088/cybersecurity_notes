# Memory injection

[[üè∑Ô∏èInjection attack]]

Memory injection is a technique where malicious code is injected into the memory of an existing process. By doing so, attackers can hide their malware within a legitimate process, making it harder to detect. The injected code then has access to the data and resources used by that process, including the same rights and permissions.

This technique often enables privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to gain higher levels of access within the system. Memory injection can be difficult to defend against since the malicious code operates within a process that may already be trusted by the operating system, making it harder for traditional security measures to detect.

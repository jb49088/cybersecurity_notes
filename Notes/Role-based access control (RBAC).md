# Role-based access control (RBAC)

[[üè∑Ô∏èAccess control model]]

Role-based access control (RBAC) assigns user permissions based on predefined roles within an organization. This approach simplifies access management and ensures users have the appropriate level of access for their responsibilities.

- **Defines access by roles:** Permissions are linked to specific organizational roles, such as manager, director, or team lead.
- **Grants implicit permissions:** Access rights are automatically applied based on the assigned role, reducing manual configuration.
- **Streamlines administration:** Administrators manage access by assigning users to roles, minimizing complexity.
- **Supports group management:** Many systems, like Windows, allow roles to be implemented through groups, such as shipping or management teams.
- **Enforces least privilege:** Users gain access only to the resources necessary for their roles, improving security.

Role-based access control is widely used to maintain consistency and reduce administrative overhead while enhancing security across an organization.

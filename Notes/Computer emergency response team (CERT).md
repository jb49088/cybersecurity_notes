# Computer emergency response team (CERT)

A Computer emergency response team (CERT) is a specialized group that handles cybersecurity incidents, such as malware outbreaks, data breaches, and system vulnerabilities. CERTs are responsible for coordinating incident responses, mitigating risks, and ensuring the security of information systems within an organization or a broader community.

- **Incident response:** CERTs investigate, contain, and resolve cybersecurity incidents to minimize damage and restore normal operations.
- **Threat intelligence:** They collect and analyze threat information to anticipate and prevent potential cyberattacks.
- **Vulnerability management:** CERTs identify, assess, and help mitigate vulnerabilities in systems and software to reduce the risk of exploitation.
- **Training and awareness:** They provide guidance, training, and resources to educate stakeholders on best practices in cybersecurity.
- **Coordination:** CERTs often collaborate with other organizations, government agencies, and international bodies to share intelligence and respond to large-scale incidents.

CERTs play a critical role in maintaining cybersecurity resilience by proactively addressing threats and ensuring efficient responses to emerging risks.

# Authorization

Authorization verifies what you have access to. It is the process of determining what actions or resources a verified user or entity is permitted to access within a system or application. Once a user's identity is authenticated, authorization determines the level of access privileges granted to that user, specifying what they are allowed to do and what data they can access.

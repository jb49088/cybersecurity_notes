[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork protocol]]

Wireless Transport Layer Security (WTLS) is a security protocol designed for wireless networks, specifically targeting mobile and handheld devices that use wireless communication technologies like GSM, CDMA, and 3G. It provides security features similar to those of Transport Layer Security (TLS), which is used for securing communication over the Internet, but is tailored for the constraints and requirements of wireless environments.

# Recovery time objective (RTO)

Recovery time objective (RTO) is a critical metric in disaster recovery and business continuity planning that defines the maximum acceptable duration of downtime for a system, application, or process following a disruption. It represents the target time within which operations must be restored to avoid significant impact on business operations.

For example, if the RTO is set to two hours, the organization must ensure that affected systems or processes are fully functional within that time frame. Meeting RTO requirements often involves implementing measures such as redundant infrastructure, failover systems, or rapid restoration procedures.

Organizations determine RTO based on the criticality of systems and processes, balancing the need for operational continuity against the cost and complexity of achieving faster recovery times.

# Capacity planning

Capacity planning is the process of aligning available resources with anticipated demand to ensure that an organization can meet its operational needs without over-provisioning or under-resourcing. It involves forecasting future demand for services or products and determining the appropriate infrastructure to handle that demand.

If demand exceeds capacity, it can lead to application slowdowns, system outages, and reduced performance. Conversely, having excess capacity means over-investing in resources, which can lead to unnecessary expenses.

Effective capacity planning requires a balanced approach. This includes adding the right amount of staff, applying the appropriate technology solutions, and building a scalable infrastructure that can handle fluctuating demands while optimizing cost efficiency.

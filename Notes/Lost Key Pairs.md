# Lost Key Pairs

Exposed or lost key pairs can be a major security hassle. Uploading private keys to public code repositories is a relatively common issue, and poor practices around passphrase management for the key pairs or even using a blank password or passphrase for SSH keys is unfortunately common.

Although cloud service providers actively monitor for both key pair uploads to common third-party hosting services and for the exploits that quickly follow such exposures, ensuring that your organization trains and developers and administrators on proper handling and management practices is an important security layer.

If you're wondering about smartcards and their use of key pairs, well-designed smartcards typically generate key pairs on the card to prevent copies of the key pair from being stored in another location. This means that the security of the card and its key generation and storage are critical to keeping the key pairs safe.

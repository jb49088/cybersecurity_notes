# Security controls

Security controls are measures or mechanisms put in place to mitigate risks and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems and data. 

## Categories of Security controls

1. **Technical Controls:** These controls enforce confidentiality, integrity, and availability in the digital realm. Examples include:
	- Firewall rules
	- Intrusion prevention systems (IPS)
	- Encryption
1. **Operational Controls:** These involve processes put in place to manage technology securely. These controls implemented by people instead of systems. Examples include:
	- User access reviews
	- Log monitoring
	- Vulnerability management
2. **Managerial Controls:** Administrative controls associated with security design and implementation. Examples include:
	- Periodic risk assessments
	- Security planning exercises
	- Incorporation of security into change management, service acquisition, and project management practices
3. **Physical Controls:** These impact the physical environment and include:
	- Fences
	- Perimeter lighting
	- Locks
	- Fire suppression systems
	- Burglar alarms
	
## Types of Security Controls

CompTIA classifies security controls based on their desired effect:

1. **Preventive Controls:** Aim to stop a security issue before it occurs. Examples include firewalls and encryption.
2. **Deterrent Controls:** Seek to prevent attackers from attempting to breach security policies. Examples include guard dogs and barbed wire fences.
3. **Detective Controls:** Identify security events that have already occurred. Examples include intrusion detection systems.    
4. **Corrective Controls:** Remediate security issues after they have occurred. Examples include restoring backups after a ransomware attack.
5. **Compensating Controls:** Designed to mitigate risks associated with exceptions to security policies.
6. **Directive Controls:** Inform employees and others about actions required to achieve security objectives. Examples include policies and procedures.

# Sideloading

Sideloading is the process of installing applications on a device from sources other than its official app store, such as Apple's App Store or Google Play. It allows users to bypass platform restrictions and obtain apps that may not be available through official channels. While it provides flexibility, sideloading introduces significant security risks.

## Risks of Sideloading:

- **Malware Exposure:** Applications from unofficial sources may be malicious or tampered with.
- **Privacy Breaches:** Unsanctioned apps can collect sensitive user data without proper oversight.
- **Lack of Updates:** Sideloaded apps may not receive timely updates, leaving vulnerabilities unpatched.
- **Device Instability:** Unverified apps can cause crashes or degrade system performance.

To mitigate risks, users should verify the authenticity of apps before sideloading, use antivirus software, and avoid granting excessive permissions to untrusted applications.

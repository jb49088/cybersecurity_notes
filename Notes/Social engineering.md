[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human psychology to trick individuals into divulging confidential information, providing access to systems, or performing actions that compromise security. Unlike technical attacks, social engineering targets the human element, using deception, trust-building, and manipulation to exploit vulnerabilities in decision-making and behavior.

Common tactics used in social engineering include impersonating trusted individuals, pretexting (creating fake scenarios to gain access), baiting (offering something enticing to lure victims), and scareware (using fear to force quick decisions). These attacks often take place through emails, phone calls, social media, or even in person.

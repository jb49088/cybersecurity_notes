[[üè∑Ô∏èMalware]] 

A **macro virus** is a type of virus that targets the macros (small scripts) in software applications, such as word processors, spreadsheets, or email clients. These viruses exploit the automation feature of macros, which can execute a series of commands within a document. When a user opens an infected document, the virus executes its code, often spreading to other documents or systems. Macro viruses are commonly spread through infected email attachments or shared files, and they can perform a range of harmful actions, including deleting files or stealing data.

[[üè∑Ô∏èMalware]] 

An **encrypted virus** is a type of virus that uses encryption techniques to hide its code from detection by antivirus programs. The virus's code is encrypted, making it appear as random data to security software. When the virus infects a system, it decrypts its code in memory, allowing it to execute its malicious actions. This method of encryption helps the virus evade detection and makes it more difficult for security programs to recognize its signature. Encrypted viruses often rely on a decryption key or algorithm to reveal their true payload.

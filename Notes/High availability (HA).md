# High availability (HA)

High availability (HA) refers to systems or services designed to remain operational and accessible at all times, minimizing downtime and ensuring continuity. It goes beyond simple redundancy by aiming for seamless failover and uninterrupted access.

Key features of high availability include:

- **Always On:** Systems are continuously operational without the need for manual intervention.
- **Active/Active Architectures:** Multiple components actively share the load, enhancing both availability and scalability.
- **Complex Components:** Often involves integrating various elements such as power backups, fault-tolerant hardware, and failover mechanisms.

Achieving high availability often requires significant investment in high-quality infrastructure, meticulous design, and ongoing maintenance. While redundancy is a core component, it alone does not guarantee availability unless paired with systems designed for automatic failover and recovery.

# Recovery point objective (RPO)

[[üè∑Ô∏èRisk management]]

Recovery point objective (RPO) is a key metric in disaster recovery and business continuity planning that defines the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. It indicates how far back in time data can be recovered to meet operational requirements after a disruption, such as a system failure, cyberattack, or natural disaster.

For example, if the RPO is set to four hours, the organization must ensure that no more than four hours' worth of data is lost during an incident. Achieving this requires appropriate backup strategies and data replication techniques to meet the specified time frame.

Organizations determine RPO based on the criticality of their data and operations. A shorter RPO minimizes data loss but requires more frequent backups or real-time replication, which can increase costs and resource requirements.

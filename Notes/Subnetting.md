# Subnetting

Subnetting is the subdivision of a network into logical groups called subnets. It works like a network inside a network. Subnetting divides up a network address range into smaller subnets within the network. These smaller subnets form based on the IP addresses and network mask of the devices on the network. Subnetting creates a network of devices to function as their own network. This makes the network more efficient and can also be used to create security zones. If devices on the same subnet communicate with each other, the switch changes the transmissions to stay on the same subnet, improving speed and efficiency of the communications.

For example, they might make one for the marketing department and one for the finance department. This is done so the issues in each subnet don't spread across the whole company and only specified users are given access to the part of the network that they require for their role. Network segmentation may also be used to separate different [[Security zones|security zones]].

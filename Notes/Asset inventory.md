# Asset inventory

**Asset inventory** is the process of identifying, documenting, and maintaining a comprehensive list of all assets within an organization. These assets can include hardware, software, network components, data, and other critical resources. Maintaining an up-to-date asset inventory is essential for effective IT management, security, and compliance.

Asset inventories typically include details such as asset type, location, ownership, lifecycle status, and configurations. They help organizations:

- **Improve Security:** Identify and monitor all devices and software to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Support Compliance:** Ensure adherence to regulations by maintaining visibility into assets.
- **Optimize Resource Management:** Track and manage resources to prevent duplication and reduce costs.
- **Enable Incident Response:** Quickly identify affected assets in the event of a security incident.

Automated tools, such as Configuration Management Databases (CMDB) or asset tracking software, are commonly used to maintain accurate and real-time asset inventories.

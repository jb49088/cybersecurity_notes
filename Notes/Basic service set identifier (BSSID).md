# Basic service set identifier (BSSID)

A basic service set identifier (BSSID) is a unique identifier assigned to a specific access point (AP) within a wireless local area network (WLAN). The BSSID is used to distinguish between different access points in a network, particularly in environments where multiple access points are deployed. Each AP within a WLAN has a distinct BSSID, which is typically the MAC address of the access point's radio interface.

- **Unique identifier**: The BSSID is unique to each access point, ensuring that devices can connect to the correct AP within a network.
- **MAC address**: The BSSID is often derived from the MAC address of the access point’s radio interface, making it a reliable and permanent identifier.
- **Role in roaming**: When a device moves between different access points in a WLAN, the BSSID helps the device determine which access point to connect to, enabling seamless roaming across the network.
- **Association**: Devices associate with a BSSID when they connect to a specific access point, ensuring communication with that particular AP.

In a network with multiple access points, each access point broadcasts its own BSSID, which helps devices identify the specific AP they are connected to. This becomes crucial in environments like office buildings or campuses where multiple APs are used to provide complete coverage.

Best practices for managing BSSIDs include ensuring that the BSSID for each AP is unique to avoid conflicts in the network. It’s also important to monitor BSSIDs to ensure that devices are connecting to the nearest or most optimal access point to maintain the best possible performance and coverage.

By understanding and managing BSSIDs effectively, network administrators can optimize wireless network performance and improve the roaming experience for users.

[[üè∑Ô∏èMalware]] 

A worm is a type of self-replicating malicious software (malware) that spreads across networks without requiring any user interaction. Unlike a virus, which needs to attach itself to a host file or program, a worm can propagate independently, exploiting vulnerabilities in systems or network protocols. Worms often spread through emails, infected websites, or unpatched software vulnerabilities, and they can quickly consume network bandwidth, overwhelm systems, or deliver other malicious payloads. The main goal of a worm is typically to replicate itself, cause disruption, or open backdoors for further attacks.

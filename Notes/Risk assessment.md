# Risk assessment

Risk assessment is the process of identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing potential risks to an organization’s assets, operations, and objectives. It helps in determining the likelihood and impact of threats and guides decisions on mitigating those risks effectively.

- **Purpose:** Provides a clear understanding of the risks an organization faces, enabling informed decisions about where to allocate resources for mitigation.
- **Steps in risk assessment:**
    - **Identify assets:** Determine what needs protection, such as data, hardware, or personnel.
    - **Identify threats and vulnerabilities:** Assess potential sources of harm and weak points that could be exploited.
    - **Evaluate risk:** Analyze the likelihood of threats exploiting vulnerabilities and the potential impact on the organization.
    - **Prioritize risks:** Focus efforts on the most significant risks based on their likelihood and impact.
- **Output:** The result is a detailed risk register or report that outlines identified risks and recommended mitigation strategies.
- **Continuous process:** Risk assessment should be an ongoing effort, adapting to new threats and changes in the organization’s environment.

By conducting regular risk assessments, organizations can proactively address threats, minimize potential damages, and enhance overall security and resilience.

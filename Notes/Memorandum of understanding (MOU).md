[[üè∑Ô∏èBusiness agreement]]

A memorandum of understanding (MOU) is a non-binding agreement between two or more parties that outlines their general understanding and intentions regarding a particular issue or project. While an MOU expresses the parties‚Äô goals and collaborative intentions, it does not have the legal force of a signed contract.

- **General agreement:** Both parties typically agree on the broad terms of the MOU, outlining common objectives or goals.
- **Common goals:** MOUs often focus on shared aims and collaborative efforts without delving into specific details or formal commitments.
- **Confidentiality clauses:** Some MOUs include statements regarding the confidentiality of shared information, ensuring that sensitive data is protected.
- **Informal letter of intent:** An MOU is an informal document that expresses intent but does not establish a legally enforceable contract.

MOUs are useful for establishing a mutual understanding and setting the stage for future collaboration, but they do not impose legal obligations like formal contracts.

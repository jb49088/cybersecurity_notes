# Authorization model

Authorization defines what actions authenticated users can perform and which resources they can access. In small systems, individual user access rights can be managed, but as systems grow, this approach becomes inefficient and unscalable. Managing permissions for a large number of users individually leads to complexity, errors, and difficulty in enforcing security policies. To address this, large systems use authorization models that group users based on roles, organizations, or attributes. These models simplify access control by associating permissions with logical categories rather than individual users, making it easier to scale, manage, and enforce security across complex systems.

# Replication

Replication is a process that provides ongoing, almost real-time backup by continuously synchronizing data across multiple locations. This ensures that there is always an up-to-date copy of the data available, reducing the risk of data loss due to hardware failure or disasters. Replication allows data to be stored locally to all users, ensuring that remote sites can access a copy of the data without relying on a central location.

In the event of a disaster or system failure, the replicated data is easily recoverable. Since multiple copies of the data exist across various locations, operations can continue even if one site becomes unavailable. This ongoing synchronization provides a reliable way to safeguard data and ensure its availability at all times.

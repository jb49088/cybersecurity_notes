[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a type of cybercrime in which attackers use fraudulent emails to impersonate a legitimate business or employee in order to deceive organizations into transferring money, sensitive data, or other resources. BEC attacks typically involve sophisticated techniques such as email spoofing, social engineering, and advanced research into the target organization to craft convincing messages. Unlike traditional phishing, BEC usually targets specific individuals within a company, such as executives, financial officers, or employees who handle sensitive transactions.

BEC attacks can take various forms, including:

- **CEO Fraud**: Attackers impersonate a high-level executive, instructing an employee to wire money or provide confidential information.
  <br>
- **Invoice Fraud**: The attacker impersonates a trusted vendor and sends a fake invoice to be paid.
  <br>
- **Account Compromise**: The attacker compromises an employee's email account and uses it to send fraudulent requests for payments or sensitive information.
  <br>
- **Attorney Impersonation**: Attackers impersonate legal representatives, requesting confidential information or funds for purported legal matters.

Because BEC often relies on email accounts and messages that appear legitimate, it can be difficult for recipients to detect the scam without careful scrutiny.

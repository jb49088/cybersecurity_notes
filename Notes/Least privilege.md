# Least privilege

[[üè∑Ô∏èPrinciple]]

Least privilege is a security principle that ensures users, applications, and systems have only the minimum access rights and permissions required to complete their tasks. This approach reduces the risk of accidental or intentional misuse of resources.

- **Minimal access rights:** Assign users and systems only the permissions they need to perform their specific tasks, reducing unnecessary access.
- **Restricted user accounts:** Enforce limited access for all user accounts, ensuring they cannot access sensitive areas or perform unauthorized actions.
- **Limited application privileges:** Applications should operate with the lowest level of privilege necessary, preventing them from accessing or modifying system-critical resources.
- **Avoid administrative rights:** Prevent users from having administrative privileges unless absolutely required, as this restricts the scope of potential malicious behavior or damage.

By adhering to the principle of least privilege, organizations enhance security, minimize attack surfaces, and limit the potential impact of security breaches.

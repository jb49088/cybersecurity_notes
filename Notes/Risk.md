# Risk

Risk refers to the possibility of an adverse outcome that can affect an organization's ability to achieve its objectives. Understanding different categories and types of risk helps organizations prepare and respond effectively to potential challenges.

Risk management is essential for organizations to prioritize resources, mitigate potential damages, and implement security measures. This process involves identifying, assessing, and controlling risks through strategies such as risk avoidance, risk reduction, risk sharing, or risk acceptance.

Effective risk management helps balance security measures with organizational needs, ensuring that resources are allocated to protect the most critical assets while minimizing the likelihood and impact of security incidents.

# USB on the go (USB OTG)

USB on the go (USB OTG) is a specification that allows USB devices, such as smartphones and tablets, to act as a host and communicate directly with other USB peripherals, such as flash drives, keyboards, or game controllers. Unlike standard USB connections, which typically require a computer as the host, USB OTG enables devices to switch between host and peripheral roles dynamically.

- **Host and peripheral switching:** Allows a device to act as either a host or a peripheral, depending on the connected device.
- **Direct device communication:** Enables smartphones and tablets to connect to USB accessories without requiring a computer.
- **Expanded functionality:** Supports connecting external storage, input devices, printers, and other peripherals to mobile devices.
- **Plug-and-play support:** Devices automatically detect and configure compatible OTG connections without additional software.
- **Common in mobile devices:** Widely used in Android smartphones and some other portable electronics for expanded connectivity.

USB OTG enhances the versatility of mobile devices by enabling direct interaction with various peripherals, reducing reliance on traditional computers for data transfer and external device control.

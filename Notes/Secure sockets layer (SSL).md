[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork protocol]]

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over a computer network. It establishes an encrypted connection between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server, ensuring that data exchanged remains confidential and protected from interception or tampering.

Although SSL has been largely replaced by its successor, Transport Layer Security (TLS), the term "SSL" is still commonly used to refer to these secure protocols. SSL/TLS uses encryption to protect data, authentication to verify the identity of the parties, and integrity checks to ensure the data hasn‚Äôt been altered during transmission.

SSL is commonly used to secure web traffic, enabling HTTPS connections, which safeguard sensitive information like login credentials, payment details, and personal data.

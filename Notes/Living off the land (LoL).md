# Living off the Land (LoL)

In a cybersecurity context, Living off the Land (LoL) refers to the tactic used by attackers to exploit the legitimate tools and resources already present within a system or network, rather than deploying new, malicious software. This approach minimizes the need for external payloads, making the attack harder to detect and analyze. By using trusted, built-in tools like PowerShell, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), or other system utilities, attackers can execute commands, escalate privileges, and exfiltrate data without triggering traditional security defenses.

The main advantage of Living off the Land is its ability to blend in with normal system activity, making it difficult for security software to distinguish between legitimate and malicious actions. Attackers using LoL techniques may move laterally through the network, escalate privileges, or maintain persistence without relying on external malware, making it a highly effective and stealthy strategy.

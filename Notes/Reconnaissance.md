# Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance is the process of gathering information about a target system, network, or organization, typically as the first step in the planning phase of a cyber attack or security assessment. It involves collecting data to understand the targetâ€™s vulnerabilities, network architecture, and potential entry points. Reconnaissance can be divided into two primary types: passive reconnaissance and active reconnaissance.

## Passive reconnaissance

**Passive reconnaissance** involves gathering information without directly interacting with the target system or network. The goal is to collect publicly available data to avoid detection. This can include:

- **Searching public databases** for domain names, IP addresses, or organization details.
- **Examining social media and public forums** for personal information or clues about network infrastructure.
- **WHOIS lookups** to gather details about domain registration.
- **Public records and documents**, such as those found on websites or open-source intelligence (OSINT) platforms.

Since passive reconnaissance does not involve direct engagement with the target, it is harder to detect and can be carried out discreetly.

## Active reconnaissance

**Active reconnaissance**, on the other hand, involves directly interacting with the target system or network to collect information. This type of reconnaissance carries a higher risk of detection but can yield more detailed and specific data. Examples include:

- **Port scanning** to discover open ports and services running on a target machine.
- **Ping sweeps** to identify live hosts within a network.
- **DNS queries** to map out domain names and their associated IP addresses.
- **Banner grabbing** to collect information about services and software versions running on the target.

Active reconnaissance often triggers security defenses such as intrusion detection systems (IDS) or firewalls, which may alert the target to suspicious activity.

Effective reconnaissance, whether passive or active, plays a crucial role in identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses in a system, allowing attackers or security professionals to plan their next steps.

# Advanced encryption standard (AES)

[[üè∑Ô∏èSymmetric encryption algorithm]]

Advanced encryption standard (AES) is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used to secure data. It replaced the older Data Encryption Standard (DES) and is considered one of the most secure encryption methods available.

AES uses fixed block sizes of 128 bits and supports key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits, offering varying levels of security. It operates through multiple rounds of encryption, with the number of rounds depending on the key length. AES is used in a variety of applications, including file encryption, virtual private networks (VPNs), and secure communications.

Its efficiency and security make AES a standard choice for government, financial, and private sector encryption.

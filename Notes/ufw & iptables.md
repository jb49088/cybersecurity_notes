# ufw & iptables

[[üè∑Ô∏èLinux command]]

The `ufw` and `iptables` commands are used to manage firewalls in Linux.

UFW and IPTables are firewall interfaces for the Linux Kernel‚Äôs netfilter firewall. IPTables directly passes firewall rules to Netfilter while UFW configures the rules in IPTables, which then sends those rules to Netfilter.

Why do we need UFW when we have IPTables? Because IPTables is pretty difficult for a newbie. UFW makes things extremely easy. See the below example where we are trying to allow port 80 for our webserver.

`iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT`

`ufw allow 80`

I‚Äôm sure you now know why UFW was created! Look at how easy the syntax becomes. Both these firewalls are very comprehensive and can allow you to create any kind of configuration required for your network. Learn at least the basics of UFW or IPTables firewall, as these are the Linux commands you must know.

# Virtual private cloud (VPC)

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated section of a public cloud where users can deploy resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and databases, with full control over networking and security settings. VPCs provide the benefits of cloud computing while maintaining a high level of privacy and customization.

- **Network isolation:** Each VPC operates independently, with its own IP addressing, subnets, and routing tables.
- **Custom security controls:** Users can configure firewalls, security groups, and access control lists (ACLs) to protect cloud resources.
- **Scalability and flexibility:** Resources within a VPC can be scaled on demand without requiring physical infrastructure.
- **Hybrid cloud integration:** VPCs can connect to on-premises data centers using VPNs or dedicated network links.
- **Multi-tier architecture support:** Enables separation of application components (e.g., web, database, and application layers) for improved security and performance.

VPCs are widely used by enterprises to run workloads in the cloud while maintaining control over networking, security, and compliance requirements.

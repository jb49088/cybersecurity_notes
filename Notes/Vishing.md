[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

Vishing (short for "voice phishing") is a form of social engineering where attackers use phone calls or voice messages to impersonate legitimate entities, such as banks, government agencies, or tech support companies, in an effort to trick individuals into revealing sensitive personal information. The goal is typically to steal confidential data like account numbers, Social Security numbers, passwords, or even to convince victims to transfer money or grant remote access to their devices.

Vishing attacks often rely on creating a sense of urgency, such as pretending to be a bank alerting the victim about suspicious activity on their account or impersonating a tax authority threatening legal action. These calls may appear to come from a trusted source, and the attacker might use tactics like caller ID spoofing to make the number appear legitimate.

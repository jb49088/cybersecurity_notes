# Tailgating

[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

Tailgating is a physical security breach in which an attacker follows an authorized person into a restricted area without the authorized person's knowledge. The attacker often takes advantage of the victim‚Äôs politeness or routine behavior, gaining access to secure spaces by simply walking closely behind them as they enter. This technique is commonly used in places like office buildings, data centers, or high-security zones, where unauthorized access is typically prevented by access control systems, such as card readers or biometric scanners.

Tailgating exploits the vulnerability of human awareness, as the authorized person is unaware they are being followed. Attackers may impersonate employees or delivery personnel to blend in and gain entry without triggering security alarms.

A Remote Access Server (RAS) is a server that enables users to connect to a network or system from a remote location. It acts as a gateway, providing access to network resources, applications, and data over a communication network such as the Internet or a private network. RAS is commonly used in scenarios where users need to access their organization's network remotely, such as for telecommuting, remote administration, or accessing resources from different locations.

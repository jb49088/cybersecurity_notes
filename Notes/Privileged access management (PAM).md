Privileged access management (PAM) is a security framework designed to control and monitor access to critical systems and sensitive data by users with elevated privileges. PAM helps organizations mitigate the risks associated with privileged accounts, such as insider threats, credential theft, and unauthorized access.

PAM works by enforcing strict policies on how privileged credentials are issued, used, and monitored. It ensures that only authorized individuals can access high-risk systems while maintaining oversight and accountability.

- **Least privilege enforcement:** Limits users to only the permissions necessary for their role, reducing the risk of misuse.
- **Credential vaulting:** Stores and manages privileged credentials securely to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Session monitoring:** Tracks and records privileged user sessions for auditing and compliance.
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA):** Adds an extra layer of security for privileged account access.
- **Just-in-time access:** Grants temporary privileged access only when needed, reducing exposure time for sensitive accounts.

By implementing PAM, organizations enhance security, reduce the attack surface, and ensure compliance with industry regulations.

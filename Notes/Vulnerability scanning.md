# Vulnerability scanning

Vulnerability scanning is a process used to identify security weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications. It is typically minimally invasive compared to a penetration test, making it a safer option for routine assessments.

Key aspects of vulnerability scanning include:

- Performing port scans to identify open ports and services, helping to map potential entry points.
- Identifying systems and security devices on the network to assess their exposure.
- Conducting tests from both outside and inside the network to account for external attacks and insider threats.
- Gathering extensive information to build a comprehensive view of vulnerabilities, with the analysis phase used to separate relevant findings from less critical data.

Regular vulnerability scanning helps organizations proactively address potential security issues and strengthen their defenses.

# Quid Pro Quo Phishing

[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

Quid pro quo phishing is a type of social engineering attack in which a hacker offers a service or benefit in exchange for sensitive information. The phrase "quid pro quo" is Latin for "something for something," and in this context, attackers promise something of value‚Äîsuch as technical support, access to exclusive content, or a free service‚Äîin return for login credentials, personal information, or other valuable data.

Unlike other forms of phishing that rely on creating a sense of urgency or fear, Quid Pro Quo attacks focus on exploiting the victim's desire for a perceived benefit or reward. Attackers often pose as legitimate entities, like IT technicians, government agencies, or business professionals, to make their offer seem more trustworthy.

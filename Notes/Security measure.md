# Security measure

**Security measures** are the practical implementations or actions derived from security controls. They are the actual steps taken to enforce security controls in a specific context. These measures are designed to protect an organization's data, systems, and physical assets from threats, vulnerabilities, and unauthorized access.

Security measures can be categorized into several types:

- **Preventive Measures:** Actions taken to prevent security incidents from occurring, such as firewalls, encryption, and access controls.
- **Detective Measures:** Tools or processes designed to identify and detect security incidents, like intrusion detection systems (IDS) and security monitoring.
- **Corrective Measures:** Actions taken to rectify security issues after they occur, such as patching vulnerabilities or restoring data from backups.
- **Physical Security Measures:** Protection of physical assets and facilities, including locks, security guards, and surveillance systems.

Effective security measures combine multiple layers of protection, often referred to as **defense in depth**, to reduce the likelihood and impact of potential threats.

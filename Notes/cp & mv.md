# cp & mv

[[🏷️Linux command]]

The `cp` and `mv` commands are equivalent to the copy-paste and cut-paste commands in Windows. But since Linux doesn’t really have a command for renaming files, we also use the `mv` command to rename files and folders.

`cp <source> <destination>`

In the above command, we created a copy of the file named Sample. Let’s see how what happens if we use the `mv` command in the same manner.

`mv <source> <destination>`

In the above case, since we were moving the file within the same directory, it acted as a rename. The file name is now changed.

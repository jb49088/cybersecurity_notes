# Masquerading

Masquerading refers to a tactic where attackers disguise malicious actions or code to appear as legitimate, trusted processes or users. The goal is to evade detection by blending in with normal system activities, making it difficult for security tools or administrators to spot the malicious behavior.

Common forms of masquerading include using a legitimate system or applicationâ€™s name for malicious processes, impersonating authorized users, or manipulating logs to hide suspicious activity. For example, an attacker might rename a malicious file to mimic a trusted system process, such as "svchost.exe," or use valid user credentials to access sensitive data.

Masquerading is often used in conjunction with other techniques like privilege escalation, lateral movement, and living off the land to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

# Structured exception handler (SEH)

Structured exception handler (SEH) is a mechanism used in programming, particularly in Windows environments, to manage errors or exceptions that occur during program execution. SEH enables developers to define structured responses to different types of errors, providing more robust error handling and ensuring the program can recover or terminate gracefully.

SEH is primarily used in languages like C and C++ and integrates with the operating system to handle both high-level exceptions (e.g., invalid input) and low-level errors (e.g., access violations or memory corruption).

- **Error detection and handling:** Detects runtime errors such as division by zero, invalid memory access, and buffer overflows.
- **Exception handling structure:** Uses specific constructs like `try`, `catch`, and `finally` to handle exceptions, ensuring the program continues operating or safely exits.
- **Stack unwinding:** Handles resource cleanup by unwinding the call stack, ensuring proper memory deallocation and finalization of resources.
- **System-level integration:** Works closely with the operating system to manage both user-defined and system-generated errors.
- **Security concerns:** Improper use of SEH can make programs vulnerable to exploits, such as SEH overwriting, which is used in certain types of buffer overflow attacks.

SEH helps in creating more resilient applications by offering structured error handling that prevents unexpected crashes and improves overall stability.

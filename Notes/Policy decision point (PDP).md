# Policy decision point (PDP)

A policy decision point (PDP) is a security component responsible for evaluating access requests and determining whether they should be allowed or denied based on predefined policies. The PDP acts as the "brain" of a policy-based security model by analyzing rules, attributes, and contextual information to make real-time access control decisions.

- **Evaluating access requests**: Assesses whether a request complies with security policies.
- **Consulting the policy engine**: Uses rules and policies to determine the appropriate response.
- **Sending decisions to the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)**: Communicates access decisions, which are then enforced by the PEP.

PDPs are commonly used in identity and access management (IAM) systems, zero trust architectures, and cloud security frameworks.

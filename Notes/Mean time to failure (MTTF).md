# Mean time to failure (MTTF)

Mean time to failure (MTTF) refers to the average time a system or component is expected to operate before it fails. Unlike MTBF, MTTF is used for non-repairable systems, such as a hard drive that is disposed of after it fails. It is an important metric in predicting the lifespan of individual components.

MTTF can help organizations assess the longevity of products and components, allowing them to make informed decisions about replacements and preventive measures. While MTTR is concerned with how long it takes to recover from a failure, MTTF focuses on when and how often failures are likely to occur.

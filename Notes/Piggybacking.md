# Piggybacking

[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

Piggybacking is a similar physical security breach to tailgating, but in this case, the authorized person is aware of the attacker following them into a restricted area and knowingly allows them entry. The attacker may ask for assistance in entering a secured area, and the authorized person, either out of politeness or a lapse in judgment, grants access.

Piggybacking can occur in a variety of settings, from office buildings to secure facilities, and poses a significant security risk. Though the authorized person is complicit in allowing the intruder access, it still constitutes a security breach, as proper access controls and policies are bypassed. In some cases, attackers may intentionally exploit the good will of employees or visitors to gain unauthorized access.

[[üè∑Ô∏èRisk management]] [[üè∑Ô∏èCryptography]]

A recovery agent (RA) is a designated user or system role that is responsible for recovering encrypted data in the event that the original encryption key is lost or inaccessible. The RA plays a critical role in data protection and security, especially in systems that rely on encryption for confidentiality and integrity.

In the context of public key infrastructure (PKI), the RA is involved in the key recovery process, ensuring that authorized individuals can still access encrypted data even if key management issues arise.

- **Key recovery:** Retrieves encrypted data when the original decryption key is lost or unavailable.
- **Access control:** Ensures only authorized users can request key recovery or access sensitive data.
- **Certificate management:** Often works alongside certificate authorities (CAs) to manage key storage and retrieval processes.
- **Security and compliance:** Ensures the recovery process adheres to organizational and regulatory security policies.
- **Audit trail:** Maintains logs of recovery activities for accountability and compliance monitoring.

Recovery agents are essential for ensuring business continuity and mitigating risks associated with key loss or system failures.

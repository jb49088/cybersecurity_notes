[[üè∑Ô∏èRisk management]]

Exposure factor (EF) is a metric used in risk management to quantify the potential impact of a specific threat on an asset or system. It represents the percentage of an asset‚Äôs value that would be lost if a particular risk or threat were to occur. EF helps organizations assess the financial and operational consequences of various risks.

Key points about Exposure Factor include:

- **Percentage of asset value:** EF is expressed as a percentage of the total value of the asset that is expected to be lost in the event of a risk materializing. For example, if a server worth $100,000 is at risk of damage, and a 50% loss is expected, the EF would be 50%.
- **Impact assessment:** EF helps to understand the potential severity of threats by evaluating the magnitude of loss. This assists in prioritizing which risks to address first.
- **Risk assessment:** EF is a key component in calculating **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)**, which is used to estimate the financial impact of a single event.

Exposure factor is an important concept for understanding risk in terms of asset value and helps organizations determine how much protection or mitigation is needed to safeguard their critical resources.

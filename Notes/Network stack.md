[[🏷️Networking]]

A network stack (also known as a **protocol stack**) refers to the set of protocols and software components that work together to handle networking tasks on a device. It defines how data is transmitted and received over a network. The network stack is implemented in layers, where each layer handles a specific aspect of network communication. Network stacks are often represented by the OSI model or the TCP/IP model.

[[üè∑Ô∏èPhysical security]]

An access control vestibule is a security feature designed to enhance access control in high-security areas. It consists of a small, enclosed space with two sets of doors. The vestibule acts as a buffer zone, allowing security systems or personnel to verify an individual‚Äôs identity before granting access to a restricted area.

This design prevents unauthorized individuals from "tailgating" ‚Äî following someone with legitimate access into a secured area. The vestibule often incorporates authentication systems like card readers, biometric scanners, or keypads, which ensure that only authorized individuals can enter.

Access control vestibules are common in facilities requiring high levels of security, such as government buildings, data centers, and corporate offices. They offer an additional layer of protection by controlling and monitoring the flow of people into sensitive spaces.

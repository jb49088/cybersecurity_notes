# Internet relay chat (IRC)

Internet relay chat (IRC) is an early real-time text-based communication protocol that allows users to join channels or chat rooms to exchange messages. IRC provides a platform for group discussions or private conversations across the internet, enabling people to connect instantly in a shared space.

- **Real-time messaging:** IRC enables users to send and receive messages instantly, allowing for dynamic, live conversations. It supports one-on-one chats as well as group discussions in dedicated channels.
- **Channels and rooms:** Users can create or join channels (chat rooms) that are centered around specific topics or interests, making it easy to find and participate in relevant discussions.
- **Minimalist interface:** IRC clients are typically lightweight and text-based, offering fast and efficient communication without consuming significant system resources.
- **Cross-platform compatibility:** IRC can be used on various operating systems and devices, including desktop computers, smartphones, and web-based clients, making it a flexible option for global communication.
- **Public and private conversations:** Users can engage in public discussions in channels or send private direct messages to others, allowing for both open and confidential communication.

Though IRC has been largely replaced by more modern messaging platforms, it remains an important part of internet history, widely used in open-source communities and by enthusiasts who prefer its simple, effective communication style.

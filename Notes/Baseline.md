# Baseline

A baseline in the context of security refers to a reference point or standard for normal system behavior, network traffic, or user activity. It provides a foundation against which deviations can be measured to identify potential security threats or performance issues.

- **Establishing normal behavior:** A baseline is created by analyzing typical operations over time, such as regular network activity, user behavior, or system performance. This "normal" behavior serves as a reference for future comparisons.
- **Monitoring deviations:** Once a baseline is established, any deviation from this normal behavior—whether in network traffic, system configurations, or user actions—can trigger alerts for further investigation, helping to identify potential threats.
- **Dynamic adjustments:** Baselines may need to be adjusted periodically as system configurations, user behavior, or network demands evolve. Continuous monitoring ensures that the baseline remains accurate and effective in detecting abnormal activities.
- **Key in anomaly detection:** Baselines are critical for detecting anomalies, as they provide the framework for distinguishing between legitimate changes and potential security risks such as unauthorized access or system compromise.

A baseline is an essential tool in security and system management, enabling organizations to identify threats early and maintain operational efficiency by providing a clear understanding of what "normal" looks like within their environments.

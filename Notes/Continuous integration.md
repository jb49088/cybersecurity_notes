# Continuous integration

Continuous integration is a software development practice where code changes are frequently merged into a shared repository and automatically tested. CI helps identify and resolve issues early, improving code quality and accelerating development cycles.

- **Frequent code commits:** Developers commit code changes regularly to a central repository, reducing integration conflicts.
- **Automated testing:** Each commit triggers automated tests to detect bugs and ensure code stability.
- **Build automation:** Continuous integration tools automatically compile and build the application to verify that new code integrates properly.
- **Fast feedback loop:** Developers receive immediate feedback on code quality, allowing quick fixes and improvements.
- **Integration with continuous delivery:** Continuous integration is often paired with continuous delivery  to automate deployment processes.

by implementing continuous integration, teams can streamline development workflows, reduce errors, and maintain a high-quality codebase.

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork attack]]

Domain hijacking is an attack where an adversary gains unauthorized control over a domain name's registration. This allows the attacker to redirect traffic to malicious servers without accessing the original web servers. By modifying DNS records, the attacker can change the domain‚Äôs IP address mappings, directing users to fake websites, intercepting communications, or disrupting services.

Attackers can hijack domains through various means, such as brute-forcing account credentials, using social engineering to obtain login details, or compromising the email address linked to the domain registrar account. Once access is gained, they can manipulate DNS records to control the domain‚Äôs traffic flow.

To prevent domain hijacking, organizations should secure domain registrar accounts with strong, unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication. Regularly monitoring domain records and ensuring that the associated email account is secure can further mitigate risks.

# Denial of Service (DoS)

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork attack]]

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a target system, typically a website or network service, by overwhelming it with a flood of traffic. The primary goal of a DoS attack is to make the targeted resource unavailable to users, often causing downtime or degraded performance. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in systems, such as bandwidth limits, processing power, or network protocols, to exhaust resources and prevent legitimate access.

DoS attacks can take several forms, such as:

- **Flood Attacks**: Overloading a system with an overwhelming amount of data, such as a large number of requests or packets.
  <br>
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Consuming critical resources like memory or CPU by sending malicious requests that require significant processing.
  <br>
- **Application Layer Attacks**: Targeting vulnerabilities in a web application's code to make it unresponsive or slow down.

While DoS attacks originate from a single source, they are often distinguished from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, where multiple machines are used to launch the attack simultaneously, making it harder to mitigate.

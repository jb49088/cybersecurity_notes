[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork security]]

Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) are advanced security solutions designed to provide deep insight and control over network traffic. Unlike traditional firewalls, NGFWs operate at the OSI Application Layer, allowing them to analyze and categorize all data in every packet for enhanced protection.

Key Features:

- **Application Layer Inspection**: NGFWs analyze data at the OSI Application Layer, inspecting every packet to identify applications like Microsoft SQL Server, Twitter, or YouTube. This allows traffic control based on specific applications rather than just IP addresses or ports.
- **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**: NGFWs integrate IPS functionality, identifying applications and applying application-specific vulnerability signatures to detect and mitigate threats in real time.
- **Content Filtering**: They provide URL filtering capabilities, controlling access to websites based on categories and ensuring compliance with organizational policies.
- **Deep Packet Inspection**: NGFWs employ advanced techniques such as stateful multilayer inspection, application-layer gateways, and deep packet inspection. Every packet is analyzed and categorized before security decisions are made, providing robust protection against modern threats.

NGFWs enhance network security by combining traditional firewall features with advanced traffic analysis, intrusion prevention, and application-aware filtering, making them essential for modern network environments.

# Key escrow

Key escrow is a security practice where a cryptographic key (usually a private key) is stored by a trusted third party, known as the escrow agent, so that it can be retrieved under certain circumstances. The goal of key escrow is to ensure that encrypted data can be accessed if needed, such as during legal investigations, data recovery, or system failure, without compromising the security of the data in normal operations.

In key escrow systems, the key is typically encrypted or stored in a way that prevents unauthorized access, ensuring that only the designated parties (such as law enforcement or the data owner) can retrieve it under specific conditions. This system is often used in scenarios involving end-to-end encryption, where access to encrypted data may be necessary but the decryption key is not readily available.

Key escrow has been controversial, especially regarding privacy concerns. Critics argue that it creates potential vulnerabilities, as a third party may be able to access the key, potentially leading to unauthorized decryption of sensitive information.

# Database

A database is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. It allows for easy retrieval, management, and manipulation of data through specialized software called a Database Management System (DBMS). Databases can store a variety of data types, such as text, numbers, or multimedia, and are used in a wide range of applications, including business, finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. The primary goal of a database is to ensure data integrity, security, and efficient access, supporting both small-scale applications and large enterprise systems.

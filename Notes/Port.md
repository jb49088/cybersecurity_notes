# Port

A port is a software-based location that organizes the sending and receiving of data between devices on a network. Ports divide network traffic into segments based on the service they will perform between two devices. The computers sending and receiving these data segments know how to prioritize and process these segments based on their port number. 

This is like sending a letter to a friend who lives in an apartment building. The mail delivery person not only knows how to find the building, but they also know exactly where to go in the building to find the apartment number where your friend lives.

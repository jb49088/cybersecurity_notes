[[üè∑Ô∏èMalware]] 

A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows an attacker to gain unauthorized remote access and control over an infected computer or network. Once installed, the RAT can enable the attacker to monitor the system, steal sensitive data, record keystrokes, capture screenshots, or even activate the webcam and microphone.

RATs are often spread through malicious email attachments, infected software, or compromised websites. They operate silently in the background, making it difficult for users to detect them. Cybercriminals commonly use RATs for espionage, data theft, or as part of a larger attack to exploit systems.

Wi-Fi protected setup (WPS) is a network security standard designed to make it easier to connect devices to a Wi-Fi network without needing to manually enter a password. WPS simplifies the process of securely setting up wireless networks, often used for home networks and small businesses.

- **Easy device connection:** Allows devices to connect to Wi-Fi networks with minimal user input, typically through a PIN or push-button method.
- **PIN method:** The user enters an 8-digit PIN provided by the router into the device to establish a connection.
- **Push-button method:** The user presses a button on the router and then presses the corresponding button on the device to automatically establish a connection.
- **Improved convenience:** Designed for users who may struggle with entering complex passwords, making it ideal for non-technical users.
- **Security risks:** Although convenient, WPS has known vulnerabilities, particularly with the PIN method, making it a potential target for brute-force attacks.

While WPS makes it easier to connect devices, users should consider disabling it if security is a concern, particularly on older routers.

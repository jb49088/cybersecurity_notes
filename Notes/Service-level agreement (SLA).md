[[üè∑Ô∏èBusiness agreement]]

A service-level agreement (SLA) is a formal contract that outlines the minimum standards and expectations for services provided between a service provider and a customer. SLAs ensure that both parties are clear on their responsibilities, performance expectations, and the level of service to be delivered.

- **Minimum terms for services provided:** SLAs define the baseline terms for the service, including key performance indicators (KPIs) like uptime, response times, and service availability.
- **Commonly used between customers and service providers:** SLAs are typical agreements between a service provider and a customer to guarantee certain levels of service.
- **Contract with an internet provider:** For example, an SLA with an internet provider might specify that unscheduled downtime cannot exceed four hours, with a technician dispatched if there are issues.
- **Spare equipment requirements:** Some SLAs may require customers to keep spare equipment on-site to ensure continuity in case of hardware failure.

SLAs are crucial for managing expectations, providing transparency, and ensuring service quality in vendor and customer relationships.

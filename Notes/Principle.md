# Principle

A principle is a fundamental truth, rule, or belief that serves as the foundation for behavior, decision-making, and actions within an organization or system. In the context of security, ethics, or governance, principles guide individuals and organizations in achieving goals, managing risks, and maintaining integrity. Principles are often the starting point for creating policies, strategies, and procedures that govern an organizationâ€™s operations.

In cybersecurity, key principles include:

- **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to those authorized to view it.
- **Integrity:** Ensuring that data and systems are accurate, reliable, and protected from unauthorized alterations.
- **Availability:** Ensuring that systems and data are accessible to authorized users when needed.
- **Accountability:** Ensuring that actions within a system or organization can be traced to an individual or process, supporting transparency and trust.
- **Non-Repudiation:** Ensuring that actions or events are undeniable, preventing entities from denying their involvement in specific activities.

Principles provide the ethical and operational framework within which organizations and individuals make decisions. They ensure that actions taken align with organizational values, comply with laws and regulations, and reduce the risk of harm.

# Key rotation

Key rotation is the practice of periodically replacing cryptographic keys to enhance security and reduce the risk of key compromise. This proactive approach ensures that even if a key is exposed, its usefulness is limited to a short time frame, mitigating potential damage from breaches or unauthorized access.

Key rotation involves generating new keys, securely distributing them, and updating systems to use the new keys while retiring the old ones. The process is commonly applied to encryption keys, signing keys, and authentication tokens in various systems, such as databases, file storage, and communication protocols.

Benefits of key rotation include:

- **Improved Security:** Reduces the exposure period for compromised keys.
  <br>
- **Compliance:** Helps meet regulatory standards and industry best practices, such as PCI DSS and NIST guidelines.
  <br>
- **Mitigation of Cryptographic Weaknesses:** Protects against vulnerabilities discovered in older cryptographic algorithms or implementations.

Automated tools and managed key rotation services are often used to ensure that the process is consistent and does not disrupt operations.

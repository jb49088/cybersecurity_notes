# Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)

UEFI stands for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. It is a modern replacement for the traditional BIOS firmware found in most computers. UEFI provides several advanced features and improvements over BIOS, including:

1. **Boot Process:** UEFI improves the boot process by offering faster boot times and support for larger disk drives (over 2 TB) with the GPT (GUID Partition Table) partitioning scheme.

2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Unlike the text-based BIOS setup utility, UEFI often includes a more user-friendly graphical interface that can be navigated with a mouse.

3. **Modular Architecture:** UEFI is designed with a modular architecture, allowing for more flexibility and extensibility. It supports a range of additional drivers and applications.

4. **Secure Boot:** UEFI includes a feature called Secure Boot, which helps protect against malware by ensuring that only signed and trusted operating system bootloaders and drivers are allowed to run during startup.

5. **Network Functionality:** UEFI supports network-based booting and remote diagnostics, which can be useful in enterprise environments.

6. **Compatibility Support Module (CSM):** For backward compatibility, UEFI systems can include a Compatibility Support Module that allows them to run legacy BIOS-based operating systems and applications.


UEFI is designed to overcome many of the limitations of traditional BIOS and provide enhanced security, performance, and flexibility in modern computing environments.

# Continuity of operations planning (COOP)

[[üè∑Ô∏èRisk management]]

Continuity of operations planning (COOP) is a proactive approach to ensure that critical operations can continue during and after a disruption. Disasters, whether natural or man-made, can severely disrupt normal business functions, and COOP provides a framework to mitigate these impacts.

Modern organizations rely heavily on computer systems and technology for their daily operations. However, in the event of a disruption, alternative methods must be established to maintain continuity. This could include manual processes such as paper receipts, phone-based transaction approvals, or other non-digital solutions. These measures ensure that essential functions can be sustained even without access to regular technological resources.

For COOP to be effective, all alternative processes must be documented and thoroughly tested before any problems occur. Regular drills and updates to the plan ensure that it remains relevant and actionable, minimizing downtime and preserving operational integrity during emergencies.

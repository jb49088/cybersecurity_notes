# End of service life (EOSL)

End of service life (EOSL) is the point at which a manufacturer or provider stops offering all forms of support for a product, including maintenance, updates, and technical assistance. EOSL follows end of life (EOL) and marks the complete cessation of service. Hardware and software products at this stage are considered fully unsupported.

Using EOSL products poses significant risks, as they do not receive security patches or updates to address newly discovered vulnerabilities. This makes them attractive targets for attackers and can result in compliance issues for organizations in regulated industries.

Organizations should plan to replace or upgrade EOSL products well in advance. Relying on unsupported products may require expensive third-party support or expose the organization to downtime, security breaches, and compatibility issues.

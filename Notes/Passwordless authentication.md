# Passwordless authentication

Passwordless authentication is a method of verifying a user's identity without requiring a traditional password. By eliminating the need for passwords, this approach addresses many security issues related to poor password practices, such as weak passwords, password reuse, and insecure implementations.

- **Addressing password-related breaches:** Many security breaches stem from poor password control, including the use of weak or compromised passwords. Passwordless authentication eliminates these vulnerabilities.
- **Authenticate without a password:** Instead of relying on passwords, passwordless methods use alternative verification methods, such as biometrics, security keys, or one-time codes. This simplifies authentication and reduces reliance on password management.
- **You may already use passwordless methods:** Common examples of passwordless authentication include facial recognition, fingerprint scanning, or physical security keys.
- **Not always standalone:** Passwordless authentication may be combined with other factors, such as a password or additional security layers, as part of a multifactor authentication approach.

Passwordless authentication offers a secure and convenient alternative to traditional password-based methods, helping to mitigate risks and streamline access control.

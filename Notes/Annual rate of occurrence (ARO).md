# Annual rate of occurrence (ARO)

Annual rate of occurrence (ARO) is a metric used to estimate how often a specific risk or threat is likely to occur within a year. ARO helps organizations determine the frequency of certain incidents, which is a crucial factor in calculating the **Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE)** and understanding the potential financial impact of risks.

The ARO is typically based on historical data, expert judgment, or industry benchmarks, and represents the number of times an event is expected to happen in one year. When combined with the **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)**, the ARO allows organizations to calculate the ALE, providing a comprehensive view of the financial risks associated with specific threats.

The formula for ALE is:

**ALE = SLE Ã— ARO**

Where:

- **SLE** is the Single Loss Expectancy, representing the cost of a single incident.
- **ARO** is the Annual Rate of Occurrence, representing the frequency of incidents within a year.

By understanding the ARO, organizations can make more informed decisions about resource allocation, risk management strategies, and the implementation of security controls to mitigate the likelihood of frequent incidents.

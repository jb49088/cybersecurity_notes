# Injection attack

This type of attack allows an attacker to inject code into a program or query or inject malware onto a computer in order to execute remote commands that can read or modify a database, or change data on a web site.

## How Injection Attacks Work

- **Injection Point:** Attackers identify input fields, URL parameters, or other points where user input is processed by the application.
- **Malicious Payload:** Attackers craft malicious payloads that exploit the lack of input validation and sanitization.
- **Execution:** The injected payload is processed by the application, leading to unintended behavior such as command execution, data retrieval, or system compromise.

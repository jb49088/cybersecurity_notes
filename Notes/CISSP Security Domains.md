These eight domains categorize security analysts job duties. Security teams use them to organize daily tasks and identify gaps in security that could cause negative consequences for an organization, and to establish their [[Security posture|security posture]].

# Security and Risk Management 

Offers an overview of information system management, serving as a fundamental domain. [[Information Security (InfoSec)|Information Security (InfoSec)]], is also related to this domain and refers to a set of processes established to secure information. An organization may use [[Playbook|playbooks]] and implement training as a part of their security and risk management program, based on their need and perceived risk. For example, a security team may need to alter how [[Personally identifiable information (PII)|Personally identifiable information (PII)]] is treated in order to adhere to the [[General data protection regulation (GDPR)|General data protection regulation (GDPR)]].

- **Defining security goals and objectives:** By defining security goals and objectives, organizations can reduce risks to critical assets and data like [[Personally identifiable information (PII)|Personally identifiable information (PII)]].

- **Risk mitigation:** Risk mitigation means having the right procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach.

- **Compliance:** Compliance is the primary method used to develop an organization's internal security policies, regulatory requirements, and independent standards.

- **Business continuity:** Business continuity relates to an organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans.

- **Legal regulations:** While laws related to security and risk management are different worldwide, the overall goals are similar. This means following rules and expectations for ethical behavior to minimize negligence, abuse, or fraud.

# Asset Security 

Provides an overview on identifying, classifying, protecting, and destroying an organizations digital and physical assets. Because the loss or theft of [[Asset Management|assets]] can expose an organization and increase the level of [[Risk management|risk]], keeping track of [[Asset Management|assets]] and the [[Data|data]] they hold is essential. Conducting a security impact analysis, establishing a recovery plan, and managing data exposure will depend on the level of risk associated with each asset.

- **Asset Identification and Classification:** This involves identifying and categorizing assets within a organization, including tangible assets like [[Hardware Security|hardware]] and [[Software Security|software]], as well as intangible assets like [[Data|data]] and intellectual property. [[30-39 Educational/31 Risk Management/0 Meta/Inbox/Asset classification|Asset classification]] helps in prioritizing protection measures based on value and sensitivity.

- **Asset management:** Effective asset management encompasses the lifecycle of assets from acquisition to disposal. This involves implementing processes and controls for tracking, monitoring, and maintaining assets throughout their lifecycle. 

- **Data protection:** This involves implementing measures such as encryption, access controls, [[Data loss prevention (DLP)|Data loss prevention (DLP)]] mechanisms, and [[Data|data]] backup and recovery procedures to safeguard [[Sensitive data|sensitive data]].

- **Physical security:** Physical assets like facilities, equipment, and [[Hardware Security|hardware]], must be protected from physical threats such as theft, vandalism, and natural disasters. This involves implementing security measures such as access controls, surveillance systems, alarm systems, perimeter fencing, and environmental controls such as fire sprinklers.

- **Risk management:** This includes conducting risk assessments, identifying vulnerabilities, implementing controls to mitigate risks, and continually monitoring and reassessing the [[Security posture|security posture]].

# Security Architecture and Engineering 

Focused on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place to protect an organization's [[Asset Management|assets]] and [[Data|data]]. One important aspect of this domain is the concept of [[Shared responsibility|shared responsibility]].

# Communications and Network Security 

Focused on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications. Secure networks keep an organization's [[Data|data]] and communications safe whether onsite, or in the cloud, or when connecting to services remotely.


# Identity and Access Management 

Focused on access and authorization to keep [[Data|data]] secure, by making sure [[User|users]] follow established policies to control and manage [[Asset Management|assets]]. The goal of IAM is to reduce the overall [[Risk management|risk]] to systems and [[Data|data]]. For example, if everyone at a company is using the same administrator login, there is no way to track who has access to what [[Data|data]]. In the event of a breach, separating valid [[User|user]] activity from the [[Threat actor|threat actor]] would be impossible. IAM heavily uses the [[Principle of least privilege|principle of least privilege]].

## IAM components:

1. [[Identification|Identification]]
2. [[Authentication Methods|Authentication Methods]]
3. [[Authorization|Authorization]]
4. [[Accountability|Accountability]]


# Security Assessment and Testing 

Conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing [[Data|data]], and conducting [[Security audit|security audits]] to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. Security analysts may conduct regular audits of use permissions, to make sure that users have the correct level of access. For example, access to payroll information is often limited to certain employees, so analysts may be asked to regularly audit permissions to ensure that no unauthorized person can view employee salaries.

# Security Operations 

Conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures. Imagine that you, as a security analyst, receive an alert that an unknown device has been connected to your internal network. You would need to follow the organization's policies and procedures to quickly stop the potential threat.

## This includes using strategies, processes, and tools such as:

 Training and awareness
 Reporting and documentation
 Intrusion detection and prevention
 [[30-39 Educational/38 Incident Response & Forensics/0 Meta/Archive/Security information and event management (SIEM)|SIEM tools]]
 [[Log management|Log management]]
 Incident management
 [[Playbook|Playbooks]]
 Postbreach forensics
 [[Lessons learned meeting|Lessons learned meetings]]/reflecting on lessons learned.

# Software Development Security 

This domain focuses on using secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services. A security analyst may work with software development teams to ensure security practices are incorporated into the software development lifecycle. If, for example, one of your partner teams is creating a new mobile app, then you may be asked to advise on the password policies or ensure that any user [[Data|data]] is properly secured and managed.

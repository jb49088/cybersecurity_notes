[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

Email phishing is a form of cyberattack in which malicious actors use deceptive emails to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, or financial details. These emails often appear to come from trusted sources, such as banks, popular online services, or even colleagues. The goal is to convince the recipient to click on fraudulent links, download malicious attachments, or respond with personal information.

Phishing emails typically employ tactics such as:

- **Spoofed Sender Address:** The email may appear to be from a legitimate organization or person, but the sender‚Äôs address may be slightly altered to deceive the recipient.
  <br>
- **Urgent Language:** Many phishing emails create a sense of urgency or fear, such as claiming that an account is compromised or that action must be taken immediately.
  <br>
- **Fake Links or Attachments:** Links may lead to fake login pages designed to steal credentials, or attachments may contain malware that infects the victim‚Äôs system.
  <br>
- **Unusual Requests:** Phishing emails may ask for sensitive information or payments in ways that seem out of the ordinary.

It is crucial to exercise caution when receiving unsolicited emails, especially if they include links or attachments. Always verify the sender's authenticity and be cautious of requests for personal information.

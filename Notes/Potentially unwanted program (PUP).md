# Potentially unwanted program (PUP)

A potentially unwanted program (PUP) refers to software that, while not necessarily malicious, can negatively impact the performance or user experience of a device. PUPs typically include adware, toolbars, or other programs that users may unintentionally install, often bundled with other software during downloads. While these programs may not be outright harmful like viruses or malware, they can lead to unwanted behavior, such as slowing down the system, displaying intrusive ads, or changing browser settings.

PUPs can be challenging to detect because they are often installed without clear consent, and their effects may not be immediately obvious. They are often distributed through free software downloads or as part of software "bundles," where the PUP is included as an optional or hidden component.

- **Adware:** Software that displays unwanted advertisements or redirects users to promotional websites.
- **Toolbars:** Browser extensions or add-ons that can alter web browsing behavior and consume system resources.
- **System slowdowns:** PUPs may use significant system resources, causing the device to run slower.
- **Changes to settings:** Some PUPs may alter browser settings, such as the homepage or search engine, without user consent.

Itâ€™s important to regularly scan devices for PUPs using antivirus or anti-malware software, as many security tools include the ability to detect and remove PUPs alongside traditional threats.

# Data classifications

Security professionals classify data into various categories to ensure that the right protections are applied to each type. Proper data classification is crucial for safeguarding organizations from potential cyber threats and minimizing risks that could disrupt business operations.

- **Public data:** This category includes information that is freely available to the general public and does not require additional security measures. While public data poses minimal risk if accessed or shared, it still needs basic protection to prevent exploitation or attacks. Examples include press releases, job postings, and marketing materials.
- **Private data:** Private data requires a higher level of protection. It consists of information that should not be disclosed to the public, as unauthorized access could lead to significant risks for an organization. Examples include internal company email addresses, employee identification numbers, and proprietary research information.
- **Sensitive data:** This classification includes highly confidential information that must be protected from unauthorized access. A breach of sensitive data can have severe financial, legal, and reputational consequences for an organization. Examples include banking details, social security numbers, medical records, and passwords.
- **Confidential data:** Confidential data is vital to an organization's operations and often requires the strictest access controls. Only authorized personnel should be granted access, and some data may be protected by legal agreements such as non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Examples include trade secrets, financial records, and sensitive government data.
- **Restricted data:** Restricted data demands stringent protections due to its importance and the potential for harm if compromised. This classification is often applied to legal documents, regulatory data, or information subject to compliance standards. Examples include intellectual property, regulatory filings, and classified contracts.
- **Critical data:** Critical data represents the most sensitive information within an organization. It is essential to business continuity and security, and any compromise could have catastrophic consequences. Access is strictly limited, and safeguards include encryption, multi-factor authentication, and real-time monitoring. Examples include encryption keys, critical infrastructure details, and disaster recovery plans.

# Common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE)

CVE is a system used to catalog and identify publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exposures in software or hardware. Each CVE entry contains a unique identifier, enabling easier reference and tracking of vulnerabilities across different platforms and systems.

Key points about CVE include:

- **Unique identifiers:** CVE assigns a unique ID (e.g., CVE-2021-34527) to each known vulnerability, providing a standardized way to refer to it across various security tools and databases.
- **Publicly disclosed:** Vulnerabilities included in the CVE list have been made public, which helps organizations stay informed about potential threats and necessary patches or mitigation strategies.
- **Vendor-neutral:** CVE provides a neutral, industry-wide standard for documenting vulnerabilities, which allows various organizations, security professionals, and vendors to share and address the same vulnerabilities.

CVE is an essential resource for security teams and organizations to track known vulnerabilities and prioritize responses effectively.

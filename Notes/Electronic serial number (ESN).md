# Electronic serial number (ESN)

An electronic serial number (ESN) is a unique identifier assigned to electronic devices, typically used in mobile phones and other wireless communication devices. It is a serial number embedded in the hardware of the device that helps to identify and authenticate it on a network.

- **Device identification:** The ESN is used by carriers and network providers to track and authenticate devices, helping ensure that only authorized devices connect to the network.
- **Mobile devices:** ESNs are commonly associated with older mobile phones, especially those that use CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) technology.
- **Unique number:** The ESN is unique to each device, allowing network providers to differentiate between devices and prevent fraudulent activity.
- **Replacement and transition:** ESNs have been largely replaced by the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number in modern GSM-based devices, though some legacy systems may still rely on ESN for identification.
- **Security and tracking:** ESNs can be used for security purposes, such as tracking stolen devices or disabling a lost device from accessing the network.

Although ESNs are not as commonly used today, they played a significant role in device authentication and management in earlier generations of mobile communication technology.

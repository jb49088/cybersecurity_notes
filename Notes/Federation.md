[[üè∑Ô∏èAuthentication methods]]

Federation is a process that allows a user to authenticate once and access multiple systems or services across different domains or organizations. Rather than having to manage separate credentials for each service, federated identity management allows a user‚Äôs identity to be shared securely between trusted entities. Federation enables Single Sign-On (SSO) across multiple platforms or organizations, enhancing both security and convenience.

In a federated system, an identity provider (IdP) authenticates the user, and the service provider (SP) trusts the IdP‚Äôs assertion of the user‚Äôs identity. This reduces the need for users to maintain multiple sets of login credentials and simplifies the management of user identities.

Federation relies on protocols that allow communication between the IdP and SP, ensuring secure exchange of identity information. Some common protocols include Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML),  OAuth, and OpenID.

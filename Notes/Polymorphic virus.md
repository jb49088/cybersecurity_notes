[[üè∑Ô∏èMalware]] 

A **polymorphic virus** is a type of virus that can change its code or appearance each time it spreads, but without altering its core functionality. It uses a mutation engine to modify its code every time it infects a new system, making it appear different to antivirus software. The virus may use encryption, randomization, or other techniques to change its signature, which makes it harder to detect using traditional virus scanners. Polymorphic viruses are often used in large-scale attacks where the goal is to avoid detection by security systems.

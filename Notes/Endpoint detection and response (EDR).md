# Endpoint detection and response (EDR)

Endpoint detection and response (EDR) is an advanced security approach that focuses on detecting, investigating, and responding to threats at the endpoint level. EDR solutions are designed to scale with the growing complexity and volume of cyber threats, providing continuous protection across all devices connected to a network.

- **Advanced threat protection:** EDR uses a more proactive and sophisticated method of threat protection compared to traditional signature-based solutions. It is designed to handle the increasing number and complexity of threats.
- **Threat detection beyond signatures:** EDR solutions utilize a variety of detection methods, including behavioral analysis, machine learning, and process monitoring, to identify suspicious activity that may not be captured by traditional signature-based detection tools.
- **Lightweight endpoint agent:** EDR solutions deploy a lightweight agent on the endpoint that continuously monitors for potential threats, enabling real-time detection and response without significantly impacting system performance.
- **Investigation and root cause analysis:** Once a threat is detected, EDR tools help security teams investigate the issue by performing a root cause analysis, helping to understand how the threat entered the system and the full scope of its impact.
- **Automated response:** EDR systems provide automated responses to detected threats, such as isolating the compromised system, quarantining the threat, or rolling back the system to a secure previous configuration. These actions can be carried out through APIs, with minimal intervention from users or technicians.

EDR is a critical tool for modern organizations, offering advanced protection and streamlined incident response to address complex and evolving cyber threats.

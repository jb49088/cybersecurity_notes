# Alert

An alert is a real-time notification generated in response to specific security events or anomalies detected within a system. Alerts are crucial for maintaining situational awareness and enabling prompt responses to potential threats or unusual activities.

Security events that may trigger alerts include an increase in authentication errors or unexpected large file transfers. These notifications are designed to provide actionable data, ensuring the right individuals or teams are informed and can quickly respond to mitigate potential risks.

Alerts can be delivered through various notification methods, such as:

- **SMS/text**: Direct and immediate notifications to mobile devices.
- **Email**: Detailed information sent to designated recipients.
- **Security console / SOC**: Alerts displayed in a centralized security monitoring interface for swift evaluation and action.

By leveraging effective alerting mechanisms, organizations can enhance their ability to detect and respond to security events promptly, minimizing potential damage.

# Multimedia message service (MMS)

Multimedia message service (MMS) is a communication protocol that allows users to send multimedia content, such as images, videos, audio files, and formatted text, over mobile networks. It extends the capabilities of short message service (SMS) by enabling richer media exchange.

- **Multimedia support:** Unlike SMS, which is limited to text, MMS allows for the transmission of images, videos, GIFs, audio clips, and formatted text.
- **Network-based delivery:** Messages are sent over mobile data or Wi-Fi and are typically stored on an MMS server before being retrieved by the recipientâ€™s device.
- **Device compatibility:** Most modern smartphones support MMS, though some older or non-smartphone devices may convert MMS messages to links for viewing in a browser.
- **File size limitations:** Mobile carriers impose size restrictions on MMS messages, which vary by provider, often requiring compression of larger media files.
- **Integration with SMS:** If a device or network does not support MMS, the message may default to an SMS containing a link to view the multimedia content online.

MMS remains a widely used messaging service for multimedia communication, though its usage has declined with the rise of internet-based messaging apps that offer similar functionality with fewer limitations.

# False rejection rate (FRR)

The false rejection rate (FRR) is a performance metric used in biometric systems that measures the likelihood of an authorized user being incorrectly denied access. It refers to the probability that the system will falsely reject a valid biometric input, mistakenly identifying it as an unauthorized or invalid entry. In simpler terms, FRR indicates how often a legitimate user is wrongly rejected by the system.

FRR is a critical consideration in biometric systems, especially when balancing security and user experience. A higher FRR means that legitimate users may face inconvenience, being incorrectly denied access, which can be frustrating and lead to poor user experience. To avoid this, systems are often designed to minimize FRR while maintaining security.

However, reducing FRR can result in an increased **False Acceptance Rate (FAR)**, where unauthorized users are granted access. Therefore, it's important to find a suitable balance between FAR and FRR to optimize both security and usability.

FRR is usually adjusted by fine-tuning the system's sensitivity or threshold for matching biometric data. A less stringent threshold might reduce FRR, but could increase FAR, thus compromising security.

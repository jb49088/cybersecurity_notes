# Key encryption key (KEK)

A key encryption key (KEK) is used to encrypt other cryptographic keys, providing an additional layer of security in key management processes. KEKs ensure that sensitive keys, such as data encryption keys (DEKs), are protected while being stored or transmitted across a network.

- **Key protection:** The KEK is specifically designed to encrypt other keys, ensuring that even if the data encryption key is intercepted, it cannot be used without first decrypting it using the KEK.
- **Hierarchical security:** By using KEKs, organizations can implement a multi-layered approach to cryptography, ensuring that keys are protected at all stages of their lifecycleâ€”from generation to storage and transmission.
- **Separation of duties:** KEKs enable the separation of roles in key management, where one key is used to encrypt data and another (the KEK) is used to encrypt the data encryption key, helping reduce the risk of key compromise.
- **Key wrapping:** In many systems, KEKs are used in a process called key wrapping, where the KEK encrypts a data encryption key, making it securely transportable between systems without exposing the key itself.
- **Compliance and standards:** KEKs play a crucial role in meeting compliance standards such as those set by PCI-DSS or FIPS, where strong key management practices are required to ensure data security.

The use of KEKs is essential in modern cryptographic systems, helping to safeguard sensitive cryptographic keys and maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted data.

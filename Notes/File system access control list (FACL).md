# File system access control list (FACL)

A file system access control list (FACL) is a security feature used to manage and control access to files and directories within a file system. It is a list of rules that specify the permissions granted to various users or groups, defining who can read, write, or execute files and directories.

- **Access control:** FACLs specify which users or groups have specific rights or privileges over files and directories, such as read, write, or execute permissions.
- **Granular permissions:** FACLs offer more granular control over access than traditional file system permissions, as they can be applied to individual files or folders and can define permissions for multiple users or groups.
- **Multiple user support:** A single file can have different access permissions for different users or groups, making FACLs suitable for environments with complex access requirements.
- **Inheritance:** In many file systems, FACLs can be configured to inherit permissions from parent directories, simplifying permission management for large file structures.
- **Improved security:** FACLs enhance file system security by providing precise control over who can access or modify files, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

FACLs are a key tool for managing file access in environments where multiple users or groups need different levels of permissions to ensure data security and integrity.

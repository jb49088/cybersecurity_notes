# Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)

SCADA is a control system architecture used to monitor and manage industrial processes, infrastructure, and facilities. It integrates hardware and software components to collect real-time data, process it, and provide actionable insights for operators. SCADA systems are essential for automating processes in industries such as manufacturing, energy, water treatment, and transportation.

SCADA components typically include:

- **Sensors and Actuators**: Devices that collect data and perform actions.
- **Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)**: Interface with sensors and transmit data to control systems.
- **Human-Machine Interface (HMI)**: Provides operators with a graphical interface to monitor and control systems.
- **Communication Networks**: Enable data transfer between components, often using industrial protocols.

SCADA systems enhance efficiency, minimize downtime, and ensure safe and reliable operations. However, they are also a target for cybersecurity threats due to their critical nature and integration with IT systems.

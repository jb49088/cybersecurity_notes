# Parallel processing

Parallel processing involves splitting a process across multiple CPUs to improve performance and recovery. This can be done within a single computer with multiple CPU cores or across multiple physical computers working together.

By distributing complex tasks among multiple processors, parallel processing enhances performance. This allows for faster execution, especially for computationally intensive operations.

In addition to performance benefits, parallel processing also improves system reliability and recovery. Faulty systems can be quickly identified, and the problematic processor can be removed from the list of available resources. The remaining processors continue to operate, ensuring that the system remains functional even in the event of a failure.

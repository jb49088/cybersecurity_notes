[[üè∑Ô∏èPassword security]]

A password vault is a secure tool designed to store and manage passwords and sensitive credentials. It helps individuals and organizations protect their login information by encrypting and centralizing password storage, reducing the risk of password reuse, weak passwords, and credential theft.

- **Encrypted storage**: Password vaults use strong encryption to protect stored credentials, ensuring that even if the vault is compromised, the data remains unreadable without the master password or authentication key.
- **Single master password**: Users access the vault with a single strong password or authentication method, reducing the need to remember multiple complex passwords.
- **Automatic password generation**: Many password vaults include built-in password generators that create strong, random passwords to improve security.
- **Cross-device synchronization**: Password vaults can sync credentials across multiple devices, ensuring users have secure access to their passwords from desktops, mobile devices, and browsers.
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support**: Many vaults offer integration with MFA to add an extra layer of security beyond just the master password.
- **Enterprise and personal use**: Businesses use password vaults to manage credentials for employees, enforce security policies, and monitor access to sensitive accounts. Individuals use them to store personal credentials securely.

Using a password vault reduces the risk of credential-related attacks, such as phishing and brute-force attempts, by promoting strong password hygiene and secure storage practices.

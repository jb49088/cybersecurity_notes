# Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)

An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone, is an aircraft that operates without a human pilot onboard. UAVs are controlled remotely or autonomously and are used for a wide range of applications, from military operations to commercial uses such as aerial photography, surveying, and package delivery.

- **Remote operation:** UAVs are often operated by a ground control station or via autonomous systems, reducing the need for direct human intervention.
- **Varied applications:** Used in sectors such as defense, agriculture, transportation, search and rescue, and environmental monitoring.
- **Types of UAVs:** Range from small, consumer-grade drones to large, military-grade systems capable of carrying heavy payloads.
- **Flight capabilities:** Can be equipped with various sensors, cameras, and payloads to perform tasks like mapping, surveillance, and delivery.
- **Regulations:** UAVs are subject to government regulations, including restrictions on flight altitude, no-fly zones, and licensing requirements for operators.

UAVs have become increasingly popular due to their versatility, cost-effectiveness, and ability to access areas that may be unsafe or difficult for manned aircraft.

# Blockchain

A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology that allows transactions and data to be securely recorded and verified across multiple locations without relying on a central authority. It maintains an immutable record of all transactions and ensures transparency, as everyone on the blockchain network maintains a copy of the ledger. Once a transaction is recorded, the data is shared with all participants, ensuring consistency across the decentralized network.

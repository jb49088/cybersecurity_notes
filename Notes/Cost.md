# Cost

Cost is a fundamental consideration in any project or system deployment. From initial installation to ongoing maintenance, the financial aspect significantly influences decision-making. The total cost varies widely depending on the platform, the scope of the system, and its complexity.

The cost of ongoing maintenance is also important. This includes annual expenses such as software licenses, support services, and system updates. Additionally, the potential need for replacement or repair of hardware can impact the overall budget, with the possibility of requiring multiple units or systems for redundancy.

Tax implications are another critical factor, as different expenses may be classified either as operating or capital expenses. This classification affects how costs are handled financially and can have long-term consequences on budgeting and taxation.

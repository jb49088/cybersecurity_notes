# Checksum

A checksum is a value calculated from a data set (such as a file or a message) to verify its integrity. It is typically used to detect errors in data transmission or storage. A checksum algorithm processes the data and generates a fixed-size string of characters, usually a numerical value or a hash, which represents the contents of the data. When the data is transmitted or retrieved, the checksum is recalculated and compared to the original. If they match, the data is considered intact; if not, it indicates that the data has been altered or corrupted.

Checksums are commonly used in data communication, file storage, and software distribution. They can help identify if data has been tampered with or corrupted during transfer, ensuring that the information remains accurate and secure. While checksums are not as secure as cryptographic hash functions, they provide a basic level of error detection.

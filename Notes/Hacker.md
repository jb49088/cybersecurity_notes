> [!info] The Hats Hackers Wear
> The cybersecurity community uses a shorthand lingo to refer to the motivations of attackers, describing them as having different-colored hats. The origins of this approach date back to old Western films, where the “good guys” wore white hats and the “bad guys” wore black hats to help distinguish them in the film.

> Cybersecurity professionals have adopted this approach to describe different types of cybersecurity adversaries: 
> - **Authorized attackers:** Also known as **white-hat hackers**, are those who act with authorization and seek to discover security vulnerabilities with the intent of correcting them. White-hat hackers may either be employees of the organization or contractors hired to engage in penetration testing.
> - **Unauthorized attackers:** Also known as **black-hat hackers**, are those with malicious intent. They seek to defeat security controls and compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information and systems for their own, unauthorized purposes. 
> - **Semi-authorized attackers:** Also known as **gray-hat hackers**, are those who fall somewhere between white-and black-hat hackers. They act without proper authorization, but they do so with the intent of informing their targets of any security vulnerabilities.

> It's important to understand that simply having good intent does not make gray-hat hacking legal or ethical. The techniques used by gray-hat attackers can still be punished as criminal offenses.

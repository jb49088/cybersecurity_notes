[[üè∑Ô∏èPhysical security]]

Closed-circuit television (CCTV) is a vital component of modern security systems, used to monitor, record, and analyze activities in both real-time and retrospectively. By providing continuous surveillance, CCTV deters unauthorized access, supports incident response, and aids in post-incident investigations.

CCTV systems can include a variety of camera types, such as fixed-position cameras for consistent monitoring of specific areas and pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras that offer dynamic movement and zoom capabilities. PTZ cameras are particularly beneficial, allowing operators to remotely adjust the camera's view, follow moving subjects, or zoom in for detailed analysis, enhancing overall situational awareness.

Advanced CCTV systems may incorporate features like motion detection, night vision, and AI-driven analytics that automatically identify potential security threats, such as unauthorized access or suspicious behavior. These systems can be connected to alarms or access control systems for a comprehensive and integrated security response.

CCTV is utilized in various environments, from indoor monitoring of building interiors to outdoor surveillance of expansive perimeters. Effective CCTV deployment requires strategic placement, regular maintenance, and adherence to privacy laws to maximize efficiency and ensure compliance.

# Policy enforcement point (PEP)

A policy enforcement point (PEP) is a security component that enforces access control decisions by allowing, blocking, or modifying user and system requests based on predefined policies. PEPs act as the gatekeepers of resources, ensuring that only authorized users or systems can access sensitive data or services.

- **Intercepting access requests**: Captures user or system requests before they reach the target resource.
- **Communicating with the Policy Decision Point (PDP)**: Sends access requests to the PDP for evaluation.
- **Enforcing access decisions**: Implements the PDPâ€™s decision by permitting or denying access to resources.

PEPs are commonly deployed in firewalls, APIs, cloud environments, and identity management systems to enforce security policies dynamically.

# Unified access points

A type of access point that combines multiple functions into a single device. These functions often include providing wireless connectivity for client devices (such as laptops, smartphones, and IoT devices) as well as integrating security features like [[Intrusion detection system (IDS)|intrusion detection]] and [[IPS|prevention]], [[Access Controls|access control]], and [[Cryptography|encryption]]. Unified access points are commonly used in enterprise environments to simplify network management and enhance security.

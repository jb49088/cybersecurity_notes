# Compliance

Compliance refers to the adherence to laws, regulations, standards, and policies that govern how organizations manage data, operations, and security. In the context of cybersecurity and data protection, compliance ensures that an organization meets legal and regulatory requirements to protect sensitive information, maintain ethical practices, and avoid legal penalties.

Compliance requirements vary by industry, region, and the type of data handled. Some common regulatory frameworks include:

- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):** A European Union regulation focused on data protection and privacy.
- **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA):** U.S. regulation that governs healthcare data privacy and security.
- **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS):** Standards for protecting payment card data.
- **Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA):** U.S. law that governs the security of federal information systems.

Organizations must implement specific security controls, audit processes, and reporting mechanisms to demonstrate compliance with these frameworks. Failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements can lead to significant penalties, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust.

Compliance also extends to internal standards and industry best practices that help organizations mitigate risks, ensure accountability, and maintain operational integrity.

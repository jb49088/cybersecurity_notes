# Simulation

Simulations are controlled tests that mimic real-world events to evaluate the effectiveness of security measures and identify areas for improvement. They provide valuable insights into how an organization and its employees respond to potential threats, such as phishing attacks or data breaches.

- **Simulated events:** Simulations can replicate various scenarios, such as phishing attacks, password requests, or data breaches, to test systems and user behavior.
- **Phishing simulations:** Create a realistic phishing email attack and send it to the actual user community. Observe who interacts with the email to assess awareness and susceptibility.
- **Test internal security:** Simulations help evaluate whether the organization's security systems, such as email filters, can detect and block simulated phishing attempts.
- **Evaluate user responses:** Analyze user actions during the simulation to identify who clicked on the phishing link or provided credentials. This data helps pinpoint individuals or groups who may need additional training.

Simulations are an effective way to strengthen security by testing both technical defenses and user readiness, ensuring that the organization is better equipped to handle real threats.

A master service agreement (MSA) is a legal contract that establishes the terms and conditions for future transactions or projects between two parties. It serves as a broad framework, setting the groundwork for ongoing business relationships and streamlining future agreements.

- **Legal contract:** The MSA is a binding legal document that defines the terms of the relationship between the parties.
- **Broad framework for future transactions:** It provides a general set of rules and guidelines that govern multiple future projects or transactions.
- **Detailed negotiations:** Many of the terms that will apply to specific projects or services are negotiated and outlined in the MSA.
- **Basis for future projects:** Future work between the parties is typically based on the terms of the MSA, making it a foundational document for long-term collaboration.

An MSA is crucial for organizations looking to establish a consistent and legally sound framework for handling multiple transactions with a partner or vendor.

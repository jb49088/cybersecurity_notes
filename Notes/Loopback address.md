# Loopback address

The loopback address is a special IP address (127.0.0.1) that allows a computer to communicate with itself over a network protocol, typically the Internet Protocol (IP). It is part of the reserved "loopback" IP range defined in the IPv4 standard. Any address from **127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255** is designated for loopback communication, but 127.0.0.1 is the most commonly used.

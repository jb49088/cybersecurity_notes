# Managed security service provider (MSSP)

A managed security service provider (MSSP) is a third-party company that offers outsourced monitoring and management of an organization's security infrastructure. MSSPs provide a wide range of services, including threat detection, incident response, vulnerability management, and compliance support, to help organizations strengthen their security posture.

- **24/7 monitoring:** MSSPs continuously monitor networks, systems, and endpoints for potential security threats, ensuring that organizations have constant oversight to detect and respond to incidents in real time.
- **Threat detection and response:** MSSPs leverage advanced security tools and expertise to detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats such as malware, ransomware, and network intrusions.
- **Proactive security measures:** By using advanced technologies and industry best practices, MSSPs can proactively identify vulnerabilities and apply patches or updates to prevent potential attacks.
- **Compliance management:** MSSPs assist organizations in maintaining regulatory compliance by ensuring that security measures are in place to meet standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS.
- **Cost-effective security:** Outsourcing security operations to an MSSP can be more cost-effective than maintaining an in-house security team, particularly for smaller organizations that may not have the resources to manage complex security operations.

MSSPs help organizations manage and enhance their security posture by providing expertise, advanced tools, and continuous monitoring, ensuring that security threats are addressed proactively and effectively.

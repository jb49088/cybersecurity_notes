# FIDO2

FIDO2 is an open authentication standard that supports both the W3C Web Authentication specification and the Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP), which is used to communicate between browsers, operating systems, and similar clients and the FIDO2 device.

FIDO2 authentication relies on key pairs, with a public key sent to services and private keys that remain on the device.

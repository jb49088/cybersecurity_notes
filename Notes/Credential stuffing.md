[[üè∑Ô∏èPassword attack]]

Credential stuffing is an attack where an attacker uses stolen usernames and passwords, often obtained from previous data breaches, to gain unauthorized access to multiple user accounts. Since many people reuse passwords across different websites, attackers can attempt to log in to various sites with the same combination of credentials.

The attacker typically automates the process, using scripts or bots to quickly test large numbers of username and password pairs against different websites or services. Since users often use weak or common passwords, the attack can be successful if the targeted service doesn't have proper defenses like rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms.

To mitigate credential stuffing, organizations should encourage users to use unique passwords for each site, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), and employ tools that detect unusual login attempts, such as IP blocking or CAPTCHA systems.

- **Penetration testing tools**: Kali includes tools for network analysis, exploitation, password cracking, forensics, and reverse engineering, such as Metasploit, Nmap, and John the Ripper.
- **Rolling release**: Kali follows a rolling-release model, ensuring users always have the latest security updates and tool versions.
- **Customizable desktop environments**: While it defaults to Xfce, users can install and use GNOME, KDE, or other desktop environments.
- **Rootless mode**: By default, Kali now operates with a non-root user account for improved security.
- **Live boot and portability**: Kali can run as a live OS from USB, allowing users to perform tests without installation.
- **ARM and cloud support**: Kali is available for ARM-based devices (such as Raspberry Pi) and cloud platforms for remote penetration testing.

Kali linux is a powerful toolset for cybersecurity professionals, but due to its offensive capabilities, it should be used responsibly and ethically.

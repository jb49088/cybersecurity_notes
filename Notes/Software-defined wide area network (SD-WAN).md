# Software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN)

Software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) is a networking technology that uses software-based controllers to manage and optimize wide area network (WAN) connections. SD-WAN enables organizations to enhance the performance, reliability, and security of their WAN by intelligently directing traffic across multiple connections, such as broadband, MPLS, and LTE.

- **Centralized management:** Simplifies network management through a centralized, software-based controller that provides visibility and control over the entire WAN.
- **Intelligent traffic routing:** Dynamically routes traffic based on real-time conditions, such as bandwidth availability, latency, and application requirements.
- **Cost efficiency:** Reduces dependency on expensive MPLS links by leveraging affordable internet connections without sacrificing performance or security.
- **Enhanced security:** Incorporates features like encryption, firewalls, and segmentation to protect data and applications as they traverse the network.
- **Improved application performance:** Ensures critical applications receive priority and optimal performance, even across geographically dispersed locations.

SD-WAN is widely adopted by organizations seeking to simplify WAN management, reduce costs, and improve connectivity for remote offices, branch locations, and cloud applications.

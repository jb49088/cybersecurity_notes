# Threat actor

A threat actor is any individual, group, or organization that poses a threat to an organizationâ€™s security, systems, or data. Threat actors can originate from inside or outside the organization and have varying levels of skill and intent. Understanding the types and motivations of threat actors is critical for designing effective defenses.

- **Internal Threat Actors:** Individuals within the organization, such as employees, contractors, or trusted partners. They pose risks through intentional malicious actions (e.g., data theft) or unintentional mistakes (e.g., falling for phishing attacks).
- **External Threat Actors:** Entities outside the organization, including cybercriminals, hacktivists, and nation-state groups. These actors often exploit vulnerabilities, launch phishing campaigns, or use social engineering to gain access.

## Types of threat actors:

- **Unskilled Attackers (Script Kiddies):** Individuals with limited technical expertise who rely on pre-made tools to exploit vulnerabilities. Their motivations are often curiosity or mischief.
- **Hacktivists:** Groups or individuals driven by political, social, or ideological agendas. They target organizations to promote their cause, often through defacement or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
- **Organized Crime:** Criminal groups motivated by financial gain. They employ advanced techniques, such as ransomware or fraud, to steal data or extort money.
- **Nation-State Actors:** Highly skilled and well-funded groups sponsored by governments. Their objectives often include espionage, disruption, or strategic advantage.
- **Insider Threats:** Employees or contractors with legitimate access who intentionally or unintentionally compromise security. Motivations can include financial gain, revenge, or negligence.
- **Shadow IT:** Unauthorized use of technology, such as unapproved software or hardware, by employees. While often unintentional, it can introduce vulnerabilities and bypass established security controls.

By identifying and understanding threat actors, organizations can better anticipate potential attacks and implement targeted defenses, such as employee training, access controls, and advanced monitoring systems.

Open-source intelligence (OSINT) involves collecting and analyzing information from publicly available sources to gather insights and support decision-making. OSINT is a valuable resource for cybersecurity, law enforcement, and business intelligence.

Key sources of OSINT include:

- **Internet resources:** Information from discussion groups, forums, websites, and social media platforms.
- **Government data:** Publicly accessible reports, websites, public hearings, and other government documents.
- **Commercial data:** Proprietary resources like maps, financial reports, and commercial databases.

OSINT provides a foundation for understanding threats, monitoring trends, and making informed decisions, leveraging data that is openly available without breaching privacy or security.

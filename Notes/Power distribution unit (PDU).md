# Power distribution unit (PDU)

A power distribution unit (PDU) is an electrical device used to distribute electrical power to multiple devices or equipment within a data center, server room, or other settings where numerous devices require reliable power. PDUs are typically used to manage power for servers, networking equipment, and other critical infrastructure in environments where uptime is essential.

PDUs come in various configurations to suit different power needs and layouts. They can offer features like surge protection, monitoring, and remote management, depending on the model. The primary purpose of a PDU is to ensure that power is efficiently and safely distributed to multiple devices while preventing overloads and power fluctuations.

Types of PDUs:

- **Basic PDU:** Distributes power to connected devices without any advanced features. It simply provides multiple outlets for devices to plug into.
- **Metered PDU:** Includes a display or monitoring capabilities to track the amount of power being consumed by the connected devices.
- **Switched PDU:** Allows remote control of individual outlets, enabling devices to be powered on or off remotely.
- **Intelligent PDU:** Includes advanced features like remote monitoring, load balancing, and network connectivity for better power management.

PDUs are essential in ensuring efficient power management and avoiding downtime caused by power-related issues, such as outages, surges, or overloading.

# AAA Server

An AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) server is a network server responsible for managing access control to network resources. It provides a centralized method for validating users, determining their permissions, and logging their activities. The AAA framework is commonly used in conjunction with protocols like RADIUS or TACACS+ to ensure secure and efficient access management in corporate and service provider environments.

The three core functions of an AAA server are:

- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of users or devices trying to access the network. This is typically done by validating usernames and passwords, but can also include more complex methods such as multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- **Authorization**: Determines what resources and services the authenticated user or device is allowed to access. Authorization policies are typically based on roles, permissions, or attributes.
- **Accounting**: Tracks user activity on the network, including login times, services used, and data transferred. This information is useful for auditing, billing, and monitoring purposes.

AAA servers are essential for maintaining secure, controlled access to networks and resources, ensuring that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to use network services.

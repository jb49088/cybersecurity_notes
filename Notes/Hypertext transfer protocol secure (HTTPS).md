# Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS)

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork protocol]]

Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is an extension of HTTP that provides a secure communication channel over the internet. It uses encryption to protect the integrity and privacy of data exchanged between clients and servers, ensuring confidentiality and preventing eavesdropping and tampering. HTTPS is commonly used for online transactions, login forms, and any sensitive data exchanges.

- **Port number and protocol type:** HTTPS operates over TCP port 443 and uses SSL/TLS encryption to secure the data in transit.
- **Encryption and security** ‚Äì HTTPS uses SSL/TLS protocols to encrypt data, ensuring that the information exchanged between the server and the client is secure. It also provides data integrity by preventing tampering or alterations during transmission.
- **Authentication** ‚Äì HTTPS requires the use of digital certificates, which authenticate the server to the client and, optionally, the client to the server. These certificates are issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
- **Data integrity** ‚Äì SSL/TLS ensures that the data sent between the client and the server has not been altered during transmission, helping to prevent data corruption and malicious tampering.
- **Widely used for sensitive communication** ‚Äì HTTPS is commonly used for e-commerce, online banking, and any scenario where personal or financial information is exchanged.

HTTPS ensures a secure and trusted connection between users and websites, providing a critical layer of security for internet communications.

# Object identifier (OID)

An object identifier (OID) is a globally unique identifier used to name objects in a hierarchical structure. OIDs are primarily used in digital security certificates, network management protocols, and directory services to uniquely identify entities such as attributes, objects, and protocols.

- **Hierarchical structure**: OIDs are organized in a tree-like structure where each node represents a specific object or attribute. Each level in the hierarchy represents a more specific entity, ensuring uniqueness.
- **Used in certificates and protocols**: OIDs are commonly used in X.500 directories, SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), and cryptographic certificates (like SSL/TLS) to define attributes such as encryption algorithms or certificate policies.
- **Globally unique**: The structure of OIDs ensures that no two objects or entities can share the same identifier, providing a consistent and reliable way to reference objects across systems and organizations.
- **Numeric format**: OIDs are typically expressed as a series of numbers separated by periods (e.g., 1.2.840.113549), which represent the path through the hierarchy.
- **Custom OIDs**: Organizations can create custom OIDs for their specific use cases, ensuring compatibility and traceability in their systems.

OIDs are critical in systems where unique identification is required, such as in secure communication, data management, and directory services, ensuring interoperability across diverse applications and protocols.

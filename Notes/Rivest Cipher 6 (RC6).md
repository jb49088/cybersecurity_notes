# Rivest Cipher 6 (RC6)

[[üè∑Ô∏èSymmetric encryption algorithm]]

Rivest Cipher 6 (RC6) is a symmetric block cipher derived from RC5. It was designed by Ron Rivest and collaborators as a candidate for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) competition. RC6 operates on 128-bit blocks and supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.

RC6 enhances RC5 by introducing the use of four 32-bit registers, a more complex key schedule, and the inclusion of multiplication operations for increased diffusion. These modifications improve its performance and security.

While RC6 performed well in the AES competition, it was not selected, with AES ultimately being awarded to the Rijndael algorithm. However, RC6 remains a strong encryption option for specific use cases.

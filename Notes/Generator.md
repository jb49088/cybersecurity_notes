# Generator

A generator provides long-term power backup during outages, ensuring continued operation of essential systems. It operates by converting stored fuel, such as diesel or gas, into electricity. However, generators require proper fuel storage and maintenance to function effectively.

Generators are capable of powering an entire building or specific essential systems. In many facilities, certain power outlets are marked as generator-powered to indicate they will remain active during a power outage. Itâ€™s important to note that generators may take a few minutes to start and reach operational speed. To bridge this gap, facilities often use a battery-based Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) to maintain power until the generator is fully operational. This combination ensures seamless and uninterrupted power for critical systems.

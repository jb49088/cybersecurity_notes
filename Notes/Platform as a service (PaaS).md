# Platform as a service (PaaS)

Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. PaaS is designed to simplify the process of developing and deploying applications by providing pre-configured environments and tools needed to build, test, deploy, and update software applications.

Unlike infrastructure as a service (IaaS), which provides raw computing resources like virtual machines and storage, PaaS offers a higher level of abstraction, focusing on application development and deployment. It handles much of the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on writing code and creating features for their applications rather than worrying about managing servers, storage, or networking.

Key benefits of PaaS:

- **Simplified Development:** Pre-built frameworks and development tools make it easier to create applications.
- **Faster Time-to-Market:** Reduces the time needed for setting up and configuring infrastructure.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale applications based on demand without managing physical resources.
- **Automatic Updates and Patches:** The service provider takes care of system updates and security patches.

Popular PaaS providers include Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service, and Heroku, each offering various tools and services for application development, testing, and deployment.

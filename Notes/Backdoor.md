# Backdoor

A backdoor is a hidden method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a system, application, or device. Often created by attackers or malicious insiders, backdoors allow unauthorized access to systems without triggering security mechanisms.

Key aspects of backdoors include:

- **Unauthorized access:** Backdoors provide a way for attackers to access systems even after security measures are in place, often remaining undetected.
- **Bypassing security protocols:** They allow attackers to avoid normal authentication processes, such as passwords or encryption, to gain control over the system.
- **Malicious use:** Backdoors are frequently used to maintain persistent access to compromised systems, enabling data theft, system manipulation, or further attacks.

Backdoors can be intentionally created during software development for troubleshooting or support, but they are more commonly associated with cyberattacks and are considered a significant security risk.

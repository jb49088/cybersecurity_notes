# Blowfish

[[üè∑Ô∏èSymmetric encryption algorithm]]

Blowfish is a symmetric-key block cipher designed by Bruce Schneier in 1993. It encrypts data in 64-bit blocks using variable key lengths, ranging from 32 to 448 bits. Blowfish is known for its speed and effectiveness in both hardware and software implementations.

Blowfish uses a series of 16 rounds of encryption, applying a combination of substitutions and permutations to transform plaintext into ciphertext. It was designed to be a fast, secure alternative to older encryption algorithms like DES, and it is particularly suitable for applications where speed is critical, such as disk encryption and VPNs.

While Blowfish is still considered secure, it has been largely replaced by more modern algorithms like AES, especially due to its 64-bit block size, which is considered less secure in the age of larger data sets.

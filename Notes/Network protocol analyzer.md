# Network protocol analyzer

[[üè∑Ô∏èCybersecurity tool]]

Also known as a packet sniffer, a tool designed to capture and analyze [[Data traffic|data traffic]] within a [[Network|network]]. This means that the tool keeps a record of all [[Data|data]] that a computer within an organization's [[Network|network]] encounters.

## Common uses

Network protocol analyzers are commonly used to capture and view network communications and to collect statistics about the network, such as troubleshooting network performance issues. They can also be used to:

- Establish a baseline for network traffic patterns and network utilization metrics.

- Detect and identify malicious traffic

- Create customized alerts to send the right notifications when network issues or security threats arise.

- Locate unauthorized instant messaging (IM), traffic, or wireless access points.

However, attackers can also use network protocol analyzers maliciously to gain information about a specific network. For example, attackers can capture data packets that contain sensitive information, such as account usernames and passwords.

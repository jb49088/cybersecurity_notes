# Virtual Local Area Networks (VLAN)

A Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) is a logical segmentation of a network that enables devices to be grouped together regardless of their physical location. VLANs operate at Layer 2 of the OSI model, allowing network administrators to segment broadcast domains in a way that improves performance, security, and management without the need for separate physical infrastructure.

Devices within the same VLAN can communicate directly with each other, even if they are connected to different switches. However, communication between VLANs requires a Layer 3 device, such as a router or a Layer 3 switch, to route the traffic between them.

VLANs are typically used to organize devices based on function, department, or security needs, and they provide an effective way to isolate traffic, reduce network congestion, and enforce security policies.

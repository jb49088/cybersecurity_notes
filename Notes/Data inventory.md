A data inventory is a comprehensive listing of all the data that an organization stores, manages, or processes. It is a critical step in understanding data flows, ensuring compliance, and maintaining security.

- **What data does your organization store?**: It's essential to document all the data your organization collects and manages. This includes identifying types of data and understanding how it is used, stored, and processed.
- **Data inventory**: A data inventory is a record of all managed data, detailing key information such as the owner of the data, how frequently it is updated, and the format in which the data is stored. This inventory helps keep track of data and its life cycle.
- **Internal use**: Internally, a data inventory is used for various purposes such as project collaboration, IT security measures, and data quality checks. It ensures that all internal processes are aligned with the available data.
- **External use**: The inventory also helps identify data that may be shared externally, whether publicly or with third parties. Organizations must follow laws and regulations governing data sharing, ensuring that only the appropriate data is made available.

Creating and maintaining a data inventory is essential for organizations to manage data effectively, comply with legal requirements, and safeguard sensitive information.

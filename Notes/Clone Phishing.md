[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

Clone phishing is a type of phishing attack where cybercriminals create an almost identical replica of a legitimate email or message that the victim has previously received, typically from a trusted source. The cloned message will often contain malicious links or attachments that, when clicked, compromise the victim's personal data, login credentials, or even install malware on their device.

The key difference between clone phishing and traditional phishing is that the attacker exploits an already legitimate communication, making it more difficult for the victim to recognize the fraudulent nature of the message. Clone phishing often involves minor alterations to URLs, attachments, or other elements of the original communication, with the goal of convincing the target to take an action that they would otherwise trust.

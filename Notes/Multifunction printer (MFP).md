# Multifunction printer (MFP)

A multifunction printer (MFP) is a device that combines multiple document-handling capabilities, such as printing, scanning, copying, and faxing, into a single unit. MFPs are widely used in offices and homes to consolidate equipment, reduce costs, and improve workflow efficiency.

- **Printing:** Functions as a standard printer, supporting various formats, resolutions, and printing technologies such as inkjet or laser.
- **Scanning:** Converts physical documents into digital files, often supporting features like optical character recognition (OCR) for text extraction.
- **Copying:** Provides quick duplication of documents without requiring a separate copier.
- **Faxing:** Some MFPs include fax capabilities, though this feature is becoming less common due to digital alternatives.
- **Connectivity:** Many MFPs support network printing via Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or cloud services, allowing multiple users to share the device.
- **Security considerations:** As network-connected devices, MFPs can be vulnerable to cyber threats. Security features like encrypted printing, user authentication, and data wiping help mitigate risks.

MFPs streamline document management by offering multiple functions in a single device, making them an efficient and cost-effective solution for businesses and home offices.

# Secure Hash Algorithm 3 (SHA-3)

[[üè∑Ô∏èHash function]]

Secure Hash Algorithm 3 (SHA-3) is a cryptographic hash function standardized by NIST in 2015. Unlike SHA-1 and SHA-2, SHA-3 is based on the Keccak algorithm, which uses a unique sponge construction to achieve cryptographic security.

SHA-3 offers variants like SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512, providing different levels of output length and security. It is designed as a secure alternative to SHA-2, offering resistance to attacks that could potentially target SHA-2's structure.

While SHA-3 is not widely adopted yet, it is a robust backup in case vulnerabilities are discovered in SHA-2.

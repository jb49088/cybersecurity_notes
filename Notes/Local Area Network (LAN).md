[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork type]]

The 1970s brought us the minicomputer, which was a smaller version of large mainframe computers. Whereas the mainframe used centralized processing (all programs ran on the same computer), the minicomputer used distributed processing to access programs across other computers. As depicted in Figure 2.18, distributed processing allows a user at one computer to use a program on another computer as a backend to process and store information. The user‚Äôs computer is the frontend, where data entry and minor processing functions are performed. This arrangement allowed programs to be distributed across computers rather than be centralized. This was also the first time network cables rather than phone lines were used to connect computers. Image 2.18 depicts distributed processing.

By the 1980s, offices were beginning to buy PCs in large numbers. Portables were also introduced, allowing computing to become mobile. Neither PCs nor portables, however, were efficient in sharing information. As timeliness and security became more important, floppy disks were just not cutting it. Offices needed to find a way to implement a better means to share and access resources. This led to the introduction of the first type of PC local area network (LAN): ShareNet by Novell, which had both hardware and software components. LANs simply link computers in order to share resources within a closed environment. The first simple LANs were constructed a lot like the LAN shown in Image 2.19.

After the introduction of ShareNet, more LANs sprouted. The earliest LANs could not cover large distances. Most of them could only stretch across a single floor of the office and could support no more than 30 computers. Furthermore, they were still very rudimentary and only a few software programs supported them. The first software programs that ran on a LAN were not capable of being used by more than one user at a time. (This constraint was known as file locking.) Nowadays, multiple users often concurrently access a program or file. Most of the time, the only limitations will be restrictions at the record level if two users are trying to modify a database record at the same time.

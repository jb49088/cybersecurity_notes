[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

A hoax is a deliberate deception meant to mislead or manipulate people. It can range from harmless pranks to harmful schemes that create panic or confusion. Hoaxes are spread through various channels, including social media, email, and word of mouth, and often involve fake events, fabricated information, or fraudulent claims presented as genuine.

Hoaxes can lead to serious consequences, such as unnecessary panic, loss of trust, or harm to individuals and communities. To avoid falling for a hoax, it's important to verify the source of information, cross-check with reliable sources, and remain cautious about emotionally charged claims.

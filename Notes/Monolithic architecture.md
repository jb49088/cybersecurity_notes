# Monolithic architecture

Monolithic architecture refers to a software design model where all components of an application are unified into a single, cohesive unit. This approach consolidates the user interface, business logic, and data input/output processes into one application that performs all necessary functions.

While this design simplifies initial development and deployment, it poses significant challenges as the application grows. The large, interconnected codebase can make updates, debugging, and change control increasingly complex. Any modification to one part of the system may inadvertently affect other components, leading to increased development and testing time.

Despite these challenges, monolithic architectures are straightforward to deploy and may be suitable for smaller applications or projects with simpler requirements.

[[🏷️Linux command]]

The `grep` command is a powerful and versatile text search tool in Linux and Unix-based operating systems. It can search for specific patterns or strings in one or more files and filter the output of other commands.

The `grep` command stands for “global regular expression print,” which reflects its ability to search for regular expressions across multiple lines and files.

`<Any command with output> | grep "<string to find>"`

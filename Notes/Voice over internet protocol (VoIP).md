[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork protocol]]

Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a technology that enables voice communication and multimedia sessions (such as video calls) over the internet, rather than using traditional telephone lines. VoIP converts analog voice signals into digital data packets and transmits them over an internet connection, allowing users to make voice calls, video calls, and send messages using the internet rather than the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).

VoIP offers significant advantages over traditional telephone systems, including lower costs, especially for long-distance or international calls, greater flexibility, and the ability to integrate voice communications with other internet services. It can be used on a variety of devices such as computers, smartphones, tablets, and dedicated VoIP phones.

Some popular VoIP services include Skype, Zoom, Google Voice, and many enterprise-level solutions like Microsoft Teams or Cisco WebEx. VoIP can be used for both personal and business communications, providing features such as voicemail, call forwarding, call conferencing, and video calls, all of which are typically more affordable or feature-rich than traditional phone systems.

However, VoIP relies heavily on the quality and stability of the internet connection, and the service can be vulnerable to issues such as latency, packet loss, and security concerns. Proper encryption, firewall configurations, and other security measures are essential to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of VoIP communications.

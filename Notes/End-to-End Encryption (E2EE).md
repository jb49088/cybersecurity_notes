# End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)

End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) is a method of data transmission where only the sender and the intended recipient can read the contents of the communication. In E2EE, the data is encrypted on the sender's device and only decrypted on the recipient's device, ensuring that no third parties, including service providers or potential attackers, can access the unencrypted data.

This encryption method is commonly used in messaging platforms, email services, and file-sharing applications to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access during transit. E2EE ensures that even if the data is intercepted, it remains unreadable without the proper decryption key.

E2EE is a key component of privacy-focused services, offering strong security for personal conversations, financial transactions, and other confidential communications.

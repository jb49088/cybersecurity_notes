# Compliance reporting

Compliance reporting involves documenting and communicating an organizationâ€™s adherence to internal policies and external regulations. This ensures accountability, transparency, and compliance with legal or industry standards.

- **Internal:**
    - Monitors and reports on organizational compliance efforts.
    - Large organizations often have a Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) to oversee these processes.
    - Internal reports may also provide details to customers or potential investors to build trust and transparency.
- **External:**
    - Documentation required by external or industry regulators.
    - Often involves annual or ongoing reporting to demonstrate compliance with applicable laws and standards.
    - Missing or invalid reports can lead to fines, sanctions, or reputational damage.

Effective compliance reporting is critical for meeting regulatory requirements, maintaining internal accountability, and building trust with stakeholders.

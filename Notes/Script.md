# Script

A script is a plain text file containing a series of commands or instructions that are executed by an interpreter or scripting engine. Scripts automate tasks, simplify repetitive processes, and can range from simple command sequences to complex programs.

- **Automation:** Scripts enable users to automate routine or complex tasks, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency.
- **Interpreted languages:** Unlike compiled programs, scripts are executed line-by-line by an interpreter such as a shell, Python, or JavaScript engine.
- **Types of scripts:** Common examples include shell scripts (for command-line tasks), Python scripts (for general-purpose programming), and JavaScript (for web development).
- **Portability:** Scripts are usually platform-independent if written in widely supported scripting languages or shells, facilitating easy sharing and reuse.
- **Use cases:** Tasks like system administration, data processing, application automation, and testing often leverage scripts.
    

Scripts are foundational tools across computing environments for accelerating workflows and enabling flexible control over software and systems.

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetworking]]

Network segmentation is the practice of dividing a computer network into smaller, isolated segments to improve performance, security, and compliance. It involves creating boundaries within the network to limit traffic flow between different parts, ensuring better control over how data and resources are accessed.

- **Physical Segmentation:** Involves creating separate physical networks for different parts of an organization. This is typically done by using different hardware such as routers, switches, or firewalls to divide traffic between isolated network segments.
- **Logical Segmentation:** Uses software-based techniques like Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) to create isolated segments within a shared physical infrastructure. Logical segmentation is easier to implement and manage compared to physical segmentation.
- **Virtual Segmentation:** Involves creating isolated virtual networks within a single physical network using virtualization technologies. This can be done through virtual private networks (VPNs), virtual machines (VMs), and software-defined networks (SDNs).

Network segmentation is a crucial practice for optimizing network performance, securing sensitive information, and ensuring compliance with industry regulations. Whether achieved through physical, logical, or virtual means, segmentation helps control network environments, reduce risks, and simplify compliance with mandates like PCI requirements. It also enhances security by restricting access to critical resources and minimizing the exposure of sensitive services, such as SQL and SSH.

# String

[[🏷️Data type]]

In Python, string data is data consisting of an ordered sequence of characters. Characters in a string may include letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces. These characters must be placed within quotation marks. These are all valid strings:

- `"updates needed"`
- `"20%"`
- `"5.0"`
- `"35"`
- `"**/**/**"`
- `""`

The last item `("")`, which doesn't contain anything within the quotation marks, is called an empty string.

## Displaying Strings

You can use the `print()` function to display a string. For example: 

`print("updates needed")` 

Outputs:

`updates needed`

## Quotation Marks

You can place strings in either double quotation marks `("")` or single quotation marks `('')`.

> Choosing one type of quotation marks and using it consistently makes it easier to read your code.

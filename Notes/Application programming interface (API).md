# Application programming interface (API)

An application programming interface (API) is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define how requests and responses should be structured, enabling developers to integrate external services, retrieve data, and automate processes without needing to understand the internal workings of a system.

- **Request and response model**: APIs typically follow a client-server model, where a client sends a request to an API, and the server processes the request and returns a response, often in formats like JSON or XML.
- **Types of APIs**: APIs can be classified into different types, including REST (Representational State Transfer), SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), and GraphQL, each with different methods for communication and data exchange.
- **Authentication and security**: Many APIs require authentication mechanisms such as API keys, OAuth tokens, or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to restrict access and ensure secure data exchange.
- **Use cases**: APIs are used in various applications, such as web services, cloud computing, mobile apps, and IoT (Internet of Things) devices. They enable integrations like payment processing, social media connections, and third-party data access.
- **Rate limiting**: To prevent abuse and ensure fair resource distribution, many APIs implement rate limits that restrict the number of requests a client can make within a given time frame.
    
APIs are essential for modern software development, enabling seamless integration between applications, enhancing functionality, and improving automation.

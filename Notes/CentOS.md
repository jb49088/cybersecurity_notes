[[üè∑Ô∏èLinux distribution]]

CentOS (Community Enterprise Operating System) is a Linux distribution that provides a free, open-source alternative to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It is widely used for servers, enterprise environments, and cloud deployments due to its stability, security, and long-term support.

- **RHEL compatibility**: CentOS is built from RHEL source code, making it functionally identical to RHEL but without commercial support.
- **Stability and security**: CentOS focuses on providing a secure and stable environment, making it ideal for enterprise applications, web hosting, and virtualization.
- **Long-term support (LTS)**: Each major CentOS version receives updates and security patches for several years, ensuring reliability for production systems.
- **Package management**: CentOS uses the `yum` (now `dnf`) package manager for installing, updating, and managing software.
- **CentOS Stream**: In 2020, CentOS transitioned to CentOS Stream, a rolling-release version that serves as a development preview for upcoming RHEL releases, shifting away from its previous stable release model.
- **End of traditional CentOS**: The traditional CentOS Linux project was discontinued in favor of CentOS Stream, leading many users to migrate to alternatives like Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux.

CentOS remains an important Linux distribution, especially for those looking for an RHEL-compatible system without licensing costs.

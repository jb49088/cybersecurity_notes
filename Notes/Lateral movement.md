# Lateral Movement

Lateral movement refers to the technique used by attackers to move through a network after gaining initial access, typically from one compromised system to others. The goal is to escalate privileges, gain more control, and ultimately reach sensitive data or systems. Attackers use various tools and methods to navigate through the network, such as exploiting vulnerabilities, leveraging credentials, or using tools like Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

Lateral movement is a key part of advanced persistent threats (APTs), where attackers gradually spread across the network, often remaining undetected for long periods. It can involve techniques like credential dumping, pass-the-hash attacks, or exploiting misconfigurations in network services to access other systems.

Defending against lateral movement requires strong network segmentation, least-privilege access controls, and robust monitoring to detect unusual activity within the network.

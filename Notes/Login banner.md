# Login banner

A login banner is a message displayed to users before they authenticate into a system or network. It typically appears on the login screen or terminal interface and serves as an important communication tool for organizations. Login banners are often used to inform users of the system's usage policies, legal disclaimers, or security reminders. Login banners serve a few purposes:

- **Legal Notice:** Notifies users that the system is monitored and their activities may be logged, often used for compliance with regulations such as data protection laws or organizational policies.
- **Security Reminders:** Provides warnings about unauthorized access, reminding users that accessing the system without permission is illegal.
- **Terms of Use:** Communicates the acceptable use policies and conditions under which the system may be accessed, ensuring users are aware of the rules before logging in.
- **Identity Confirmation:** Reinforces the legitimacy of the system and can act as an assurance to users that they are accessing the correct environment.

Login banners are an essential part of system security, ensuring that users are aware of the system's policies and potential legal implications before accessing sensitive information.

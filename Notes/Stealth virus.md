[[üè∑Ô∏èMalware]] 

A **stealth virus** is a type of virus that actively hides its presence from antivirus programs and users by using various techniques to avoid detection. These viruses may alter system files, hook into system processes, or manipulate the operating system to make themselves invisible to security scans. Stealth viruses often attempt to conceal the changes they make, such as hiding files or preventing antivirus programs from detecting their presence. They can be particularly difficult to remove since they can evade detection and avoid being cleaned by traditional antivirus methods.

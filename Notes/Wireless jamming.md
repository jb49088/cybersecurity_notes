[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork attack]]

Wireless jamming is a deliberate attempt to disrupt wireless communication by interfering with signal transmission. There are various types of jamming, including:

- **Constant Jamming**: Sending random bits or legitimate frames continuously.
- **Random Jamming**: Sending data or legitimate frames at random intervals.
- **Reactive Jamming**: Only transmitting interference when another device attempts to communicate.

Effective jamming requires proximity, as the signal strength diminishes with distance. Locating a jammer, often called "fox hunting," involves specialized tools such as directional antennas and attenuators to pinpoint the source of interference.

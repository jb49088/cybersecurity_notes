[[üè∑Ô∏èPhysical security]]

Bollards are short, sturdy posts used to protect buildings, pedestrians, and infrastructure from vehicle-based threats. Positioned in high-risk areas such as building entrances or along roadways, they serve as physical barriers to prevent unauthorized vehicles from entering. Bollards are typically made from durable materials like steel or concrete and can be fixed, removable, or retractable, depending on the access control needs of the area.

While their primary function is to stop vehicles, bollards are designed to allow pedestrian and cyclist movement. They can be aesthetically designed to blend into the environment while providing critical security. Bollards are commonly used in high-security areas, urban planning, transportation infrastructure, and public spaces to enhance safety and minimize the risk of vehicle attacks.

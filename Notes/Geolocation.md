# Geolocation

Geolocation refers to the process of determining the physical location of a device or user within a localized area. This location data can be gathered in various ways, including through Wi-Fi signals (802.11), mobile network providers, and Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. Geolocation is an essential tool for applications that require location-based information, such as navigation, location-based services, and even security management.

One of the key uses of geolocation is to manage data access based on geographic location. For example, businesses may restrict access to certain resources or sensitive data from users located in specific countries or regions. Geolocation can also be employed to control access to administrative tasks, ensuring that only authorized personnel can perform critical operations from secure locations, such as within a corporate building or VPN-secured area. This functionality can enhance security by preventing unauthorized access from potentially unsafe or distant locations, while permitting enhanced access when users are within trusted physical zones.

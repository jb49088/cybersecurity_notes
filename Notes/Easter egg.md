# Easter egg

[[🏷️Development]]

An Easter egg in software is a hidden feature or message intentionally placed by developers, often as a fun or playful addition. These secret features are usually not documented and are meant to be discovered by users through exploration. Common examples include hidden games, jokes, or references to pop culture.

While mostly harmless, Easter eggs can sometimes be misused to hide malicious code or vulnerabilities. Today, due to security concerns, they are less common in modern software development.

# IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi)

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork protocol]]

IEEE 802.11 defines the standards for wireless local area networks (WLANs), commonly known as Wi-Fi. These standards enable devices to communicate wirelessly, with versions offering increasing speeds and security over time. Wi-Fi operates on 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and the newer 6 GHz bands (Wi-Fi 6E), with newer versions like Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) offering faster speeds and better performance in crowded environments.

Security has improved from WEP to WPA2 and WPA3, providing stronger encryption and authentication. Management frames, which help manage connections and network functions, are often unencrypted and vulnerable to attacks. To address this, management frame protection (MFP) was introduced in 802.11w to secure these frames from spoofing and unauthorized disconnections.

Wi-Fi continues to evolve, with Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be) promising even faster speeds and better efficiency.

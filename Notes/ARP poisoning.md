# ARP poisoning

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork attack]]

ARP poisoning is an on-path attack targeting the address resolution protocol (ARP) within a local IP subnet. Since ARP lacks security mechanisms, attackers exploit this vulnerability to associate their device's MAC address with the IP address of another device, such as a gateway or server.

Once successful, the attacker intercepts or manipulates traffic between devices on the network, enabling activities such as data theft, session hijacking, or traffic redirection. ARP poisoning is commonly used in conjunction with other attacks like packet sniffing or injecting malicious data.

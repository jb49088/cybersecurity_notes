# X.509

X.509 is a widely used standard for defining digital certificates, which are used to authenticate the identity of users, devices, or services in various security protocols, including SSL/TLS for secure web browsing. It specifies the format for public key certificates, including the structure and fields required for secure communications.

- **Digital certificates:** X.509 certificates bind public keys to identities, ensuring secure communication by verifying the legitimacy of a party.
- **Certificate Authority (CA):** X.509 certificates are issued by trusted CAs, which act as a third-party verifier of the identity associated with a public key.
- **Public key infrastructure (PKI):** Works within a PKI framework to enable encryption, authentication, and digital signatures.
- **Certificate fields:** Contains essential information, including the subject, issuer, validity period, and public key.
- **Support for encryption protocols:** Commonly used in securing email, VPNs, and HTTPS websites.

X.509 plays a critical role in securing online communications by providing a trusted system for verifying identities and encrypting data.

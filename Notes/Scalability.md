# Scalability

Scalability refers to the ability of a system to efficiently increase or decrease its capacity to handle changing demands. This can happen frequently, depending on usage patterns, and is often referred to as elasticity. A scalable system allows businesses to respond quickly to increased loads or decreased needs, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization.

However, scalability always comes with resource challenges. Identifying and addressing the factors that prevent scalability, such as hardware limitations, software bottlenecks, or network constraints, is crucial. Additionally, as the system scales, it must also incorporate robust security monitoring to ensure that security remains intact during growth or contraction. This scalability of security should adjust dynamically alongside the system's scaling efforts.

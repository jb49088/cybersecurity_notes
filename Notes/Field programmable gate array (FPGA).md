# Field programmable gate array (FPGA)

A field programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit that can be programmed or reconfigured after manufacturing to perform a wide range of tasks. FPGAs are commonly used in applications that require hardware customization, such as digital signal processing, telecommunications, and embedded systems.

- **Customizable hardware:** Unlike traditional chips with fixed functions, FPGAs consist of a matrix of programmable logic blocks and interconnects, allowing users to tailor the device to specific applications or tasks.
- **Parallel processing:** FPGAs support parallel processing, enabling multiple operations to be performed simultaneously, making them suitable for high-performance applications that require real-time processing.
- **Reconfigurable:** One of the key features of an FPGA is that it can be reprogrammed as needed, which makes it flexible and adaptable to changing requirements or improvements in design.
- **Speed and efficiency:** FPGAs provide faster processing speeds than general-purpose processors for specific tasks because the hardware is tailored to the application's needs, reducing bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
- **Applications:** FPGAs are used in various industries, including telecommunications, automotive, aerospace, and consumer electronics, for tasks such as signal processing, encryption, machine learning, and image processing.

FPGAs offer significant flexibility and performance advantages for applications that require custom hardware solutions, enabling faster, more efficient execution of specific tasks.

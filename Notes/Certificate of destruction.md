# Certificate of destruction

A certificate of destruction is a formal document provided by a third-party service to confirm that sensitive data or media has been securely destroyed. This is essential for ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and maintaining a clear audit trail.

Destruction is often performed by specialized third-party services, as most organizations lack tools like drills or degaussers for secure data destruction. The service should provide a certificate confirming that all data was destroyed according to agreed-upon standards. This certificate serves as a paper trail, detailing the destruction process and providing proof that the data was rendered irrecoverable.

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork protocol]]

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol that ensures secure communication over a network. It is the successor to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and provides encryption, authentication, and data integrity to protect information exchanged between a client and a server.

TLS is widely used in securing web traffic (HTTPS), email communication, file transfers, and other network-based services. It operates by establishing a handshake between the client and server to negotiate encryption keys and verify identities before data transmission begins.

Compared to SSL, TLS offers improved security features and performance, making it the preferred protocol for modern secure communications.

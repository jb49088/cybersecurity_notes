# Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. IaaS delivers computing infrastructure, including servers, storage, networking, and other essential components, as an on-demand service. This eliminates the need for businesses to own and maintain physical servers, data centers, and other hardware, providing a more flexible, scalable, and cost-effective solution for managing IT infrastructure.

With IaaS, organizations can rent computing resources as needed, scaling them up or down depending on demand. The service is typically billed on a pay-as-you-go basis, meaning businesses only pay for the resources they actually use.

Key benefits of IaaS:

- **Scalability:** Easily adjust resources based on demand.
- **Cost-effectiveness:** Avoid upfront capital expenditures for hardware and only pay for the resources used.
- **Flexibility:** Customize and configure the infrastructure based on specific needs.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Cloud-based infrastructure provides better resilience and uptime.

Popular IaaS providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which offer a range of virtual machines, storage solutions, and networking capabilities to meet the diverse needs of organizations.

# Attack surface

The attack surface of a system refers to the total number of potential entry points or vulnerabilities through which an attacker can exploit the system. Just like how a house has various entry points, such as doors, windows, and basements, a system can have multiple pathways that could be targeted by malicious actors.

Every component within the system can contribute to the attack surface, including:

- **Application code**: Bugs, vulnerabilities, or insecure coding practices in the software can provide attackers with opportunities to exploit the system.
- **Open ports**: Network ports left open for communication can potentially be targeted by attackers, especially if unnecessary ports are left exposed.
- **Authentication process**: Weak or misconfigured authentication systems, often exacerbated by human error, can provide attackers with an entry point into the system.

Minimizing the attack surface is crucial for improving system security. Key measures include:

- Auditing the code to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
- Blocking unused or unnecessary ports on the firewall to limit potential entry points.
- Continuously monitoring network traffic in real-time to detect suspicious activity.

Reducing the attack surface helps lower the risk of successful attacks by limiting the number of possible access points.

# Personal identity verification (PIV)

Personal identity verification (PIV) is a standardized method for verifying an individualâ€™s identity using a government-issued smart card. It is primarily used by U.S. federal agencies to ensure secure access to physical and digital resources. PIV cards contain embedded cryptographic credentials that enable strong authentication, encryption, and digital signatures.

- **Secure authentication:** PIV cards provide multi-factor authentication through a combination of a smart card, PIN, and sometimes biometrics.
- **Access control:** Used for both **physical access** (e.g., entering secure buildings) and **logical access** (e.g., logging into government systems).
- **Encryption and digital signatures:** Supports **data encryption** and **electronic document signing** to enhance security and prevent tampering.
- **Government standard:** Mandated by the **Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201**, issued by **NIST**, for all U.S. federal employees and contractors.
- **Interoperability:** Designed to be used across multiple agencies, ensuring a standardized approach to identity verification and access control.

PIV is a critical component of federal cybersecurity efforts, strengthening identity assurance and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

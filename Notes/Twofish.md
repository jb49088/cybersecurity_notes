# Twofish

[[üè∑Ô∏èSymmetric encryption algorithm]]

Twofish is a symmetric-key block cipher and the successor to Blowfish, designed by Bruce Schneier and others. It encrypts data in 128-bit blocks using key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits. Twofish was a finalist in the competition to select the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) but was ultimately not chosen.

Twofish operates through 16 rounds of encryption, utilizing a combination of key-dependent S-boxes and a complex structure that includes a Feistel network. It is known for its strong security, efficiency, and flexibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from file encryption to secure communications.

Despite not being adopted as AES, Twofish remains a secure and viable alternative to AES, particularly in environments where key flexibility is needed.

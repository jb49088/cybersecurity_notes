# Structured threat information expression (STIX)

Structured threat information expression (STIX) is a standardized language used for representing and sharing cyber threat intelligence (CTI). It allows organizations, security analysts, and automated systems to communicate threat information in a structured and machine-readable format. STIX helps improve threat detection, response, and collaboration across different cybersecurity entities.

- **Observables**: Basic events or artifacts such as IP addresses, file hashes, or domain names associated with threats.
- **Indicators**: Patterns of suspicious activity that suggest potential cyber threats.
- **Threat actors**: Individuals or groups responsible for cyberattacks, including their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
- **Attack patterns**: Methods used by threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities or compromise systems.
- **Courses of action**: Recommended defensive measures to mitigate or respond to specific threats.
- **Incidents**: Documented cyberattacks or breaches that provide insights into real-world threats.
- **Malware**: Information about malicious software, including its behavior and signatures.
- **Relationships**: Links between different STIX components to create a comprehensive threat intelligence picture.

STIX is widely used by government agencies, cybersecurity vendors, and enterprises to facilitate intelligence sharing and improve threat detection through structured and automated analysis.

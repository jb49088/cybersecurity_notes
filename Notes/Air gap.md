# Air gap

An air gap is a security measure where devices or systems are physically isolated from each other, ensuring no direct connection exists between them. This separation creates a secure barrier, preventing unauthorized access or data mixing across networks or systems.

For example, web servers might be housed in one rack while database servers are placed in another, ensuring clear boundaries between application tiers. Similarly, customer networks can be isolated, with Customer A’s devices on one switch and Customer B’s devices on another, preventing data intermingling.

Communication between air-gapped systems requires intentional connections, such as a direct link or through intermediary switches or routers. This deliberate design minimizes risk and ensures greater data security.

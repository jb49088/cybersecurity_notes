# export

[[🏷️Linux command]]

The `export` command in Linux and Unix-based operating systems is used to set environment variables. Environment variables are used to store information that can be used by processes or commands.

Once an environment variable is set, it can be accessed by any process or command that is running in the same shell.

Environment variables can be used to store a wide range of information, such as configuration settings, user preferences, or system information.

Here’s an example of using the `export` command:

`export <variable name>=<value>`

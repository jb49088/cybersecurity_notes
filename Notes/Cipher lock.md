# Cipher lock

A cipher lock is a type of mechanical locking system that operates using a rotating dial or series of buttons, where a specific combination or code must be entered to gain access. Unlike traditional key locks, cipher locks do not rely on physical keys. Instead, they use a numeric or alphanumeric code entered through rotating dials, push-button keypads, or similar mechanisms.

Cipher locks are often used for securing doors, safes, and other areas requiring controlled access. They provide an added level of security by eliminating the need for keys, which can be lost or duplicated. The combination or code to open the lock is typically kept confidential, and changing the combination is straightforward without needing to replace or re-key locks.

While cipher locks are generally considered secure, their vulnerability lies in potential methods for brute-forcing the code or observing someone inputting the combination. Additionally, older mechanical cipher locks may be easier to manipulate or bypass compared to modern digital or biometric systems.

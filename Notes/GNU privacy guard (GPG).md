# GNU privacy guard (GPG)

GNU privacy guard (GPG) is a free, open-source encryption software used for secure communication and data protection. It implements the OpenPGP standard and allows for encrypting, signing, and verifying the integrity of messages and files.

- **Encryption and decryption:** GPG provides asymmetric encryption, where a pair of keys (public and private) is used. The public key is used to encrypt data, while the private key is used to decrypt it, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read the message.
- **Digital signatures:** GPG also allows users to sign messages or files digitally, ensuring authenticity and integrity. A digital signature verifies the identity of the sender and ensures that the content has not been tampered with.
- **Key management:** GPG includes features for key management, allowing users to generate, distribute, and revoke encryption keys. Public keys are shared openly, while private keys are kept securely by the user.
- **Compatibility:** GPG is compatible with a wide range of email clients and operating systems, enabling secure communication across different platforms.
- **Open-source and free:** GPG is free software, and its open-source nature allows users to review the code, ensuring transparency and security.

GPG is widely used for secure communication, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity in data transmission, particularly in email systems and file sharing.

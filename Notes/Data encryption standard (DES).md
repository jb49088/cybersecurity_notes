[[üè∑Ô∏èSymmetric encryption algorithm]]

Data encryption standard (DES) is an older symmetric encryption algorithm that was widely used to secure data. It encrypts data in 64-bit blocks using a 56-bit key. While it was once considered secure, advancements in computational power made it vulnerable to brute-force attacks, leading to its eventual replacement by more secure algorithms like AES.

DES operates through 16 rounds of encryption, applying a series of permutations and substitutions to transform the plaintext into ciphertext. Despite its historical use, DES is now considered insecure for most applications due to its relatively short key length and susceptibility to modern attack methods.

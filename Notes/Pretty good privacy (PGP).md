Pretty good privacy (PGP) is an encryption program that provides secure communication and data storage. It uses a combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography to protect email messages, files, and other sensitive information.

Key features include:

- **Encryption:** Protects data confidentiality during transmission or storage.
- **Digital Signatures:** Verifies sender identity and message integrity.
- **Key Management:** Combines public and private keys for secure encryption and decryption.

PGP is widely used in secure communications and has been adopted in standards like OpenPGP.

# Hosting models

## Self-hosted

Refers to applications or services that are deployed on infrastructure managed and maintained by the organization itself, rather than relying on third-party cloud infrastructure. In a self-hosted setup, the organization is responsible for procuring, configuring, and managing the [[Hardware Security|hardware]] and [[Software Security|software]] necessary to run the applications or services internally.

## Cloud-hosted

Refers to applications or services that are deployed on cloud infrastructure but are not specifically designed for cloud infrastructure. These applications are often migrated from on-premise [[Server|servers]] to cloud environments without significant modification.

## Cloud-native

Refers to applications or services that are built from the ground up to run in the cloud. These applications are designed with cloud principles in mind, such as availability, flexibility, and scalability.

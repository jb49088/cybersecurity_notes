# Mobile device management (MDM)

Mobile device management (MDM) is a solution that allows organizations to manage and secure both company-owned and user-owned mobile devices. MDM is essential for enforcing security policies, monitoring usage, and ensuring the safe operation of devices within a business environment. With the rise of bring your own device (BYOD) policies, MDM plays a crucial role in managing personal devices used for work purposes.

- **Manage company-owned and user-owned mobile devices**: MDM provides centralized management for both types of devices, ensuring consistent policies and security measures are applied.
- **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)**: MDM helps businesses control and secure personal devices that employees bring into the workplace without accessing personal data.
- **Centralized management of mobile devices**: MDM enables IT administrators to monitor, configure, and enforce policies across devices from a single platform, simplifying device management.
- **Specialized functionality**: MDM platforms offer tools for managing apps, data, camera settings, and other device features to ensure compliance with organizational policies.
- **Set policies on apps, data, camera, etc.**: Administrators can define and enforce policies on which apps can be installed, restrict access to certain data, and control hardware features like the camera.
- **Control the remote device**: MDM allows administrators to remotely lock, wipe, or configure devices as needed for security purposes, such as in the event of a lost or stolen device.
- **The entire device or a “partition”**: Administrators can remotely wipe or lock the entire device or target specific areas, such as corporate data, while leaving personal information untouched.
- **Manage access control**: MDM solutions can enforce security measures like mandatory screen locks, PIN codes, and device encryption to protect access to corporate resources.

By implementing MDM, organizations can ensure the security and proper management of both company-issued and personal mobile devices while maintaining a secure and efficient workplace.

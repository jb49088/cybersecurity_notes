[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

Whaling is a type of spear-phishing attack that specifically targets high-profile individuals within an organization, such as executives, senior management, or key decision-makers. The goal of whaling is to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial data, or confidential business information, by exploiting the victim's authority and trust. Unlike general phishing or angler phishing, whaling attacks are highly personalized and crafted to appeal to the specific role and responsibilities of the target.

Whaling attackers often use carefully crafted emails or other forms of communication that appear to come from trusted sources, such as colleagues, business partners, or reputable organizations. These messages often contain urgent or important requests to make the victim act quickly‚Äîsuch as transferring funds, approving financial transactions, or disclosing confidential data.

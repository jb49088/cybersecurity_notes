# Quality of service (QoS)

Quality of service (QoS) refers to the ability of a network to manage and prioritize traffic to ensure optimal performance for critical applications. QoS helps prevent issues like latency, jitter, and packet loss by allocating bandwidth and prioritizing certain types of network traffic over others.

QoS is essential for applications that require real-time communication, such as voice over IP (VoIP), video conferencing, and online gaming. It ensures that these services receive the necessary resources while preventing congestion from lower-priority traffic.

- **Traffic prioritization:** Assigns different priority levels to various types of network traffic, ensuring critical applications receive adequate bandwidth.
- **Bandwidth management:** Controls the allocation of network resources to prevent congestion and maintain consistent performance.
- **Latency and jitter reduction:** Minimizes delays and fluctuations in data transmission, improving the quality of real-time services.
- **Packet loss prevention:** Helps ensure reliable data delivery by managing network congestion.
- **Common QoS techniques:** Includes traffic shaping, packet classification, queuing mechanisms, and congestion avoidance strategies.

QoS is widely used in enterprise networks, service provider infrastructure, and multimedia applications to enhance network reliability and user experience.

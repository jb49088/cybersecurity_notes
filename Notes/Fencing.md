[[üè∑Ô∏èPhysical security]]

Fencing is a physical security measure used to establish boundaries, restrict unauthorized access, and protect assets. It typically consists of a barrier, such as a metal, wooden, or concrete structure, designed to deter intruders and control the movement of people or vehicles. Fencing is widely used in residential, commercial, and industrial settings, as well as critical infrastructure sites, to enhance perimeter security.

Fencing serves as both a preventive and deterrent security control by signaling that entry is restricted and providing a barrier that intruders must overcome. It can be tailored to specific security needs, with options including chain-link fences for basic security, barbed or razor wire for increased deterrence, and high-security designs like anti-climb fences for sensitive areas. Advanced fencing systems may integrate with electronic access control, surveillance cameras, or intrusion detection systems for comprehensive perimeter protection.

In addition to security, fencing helps direct pedestrian and vehicular traffic, ensuring organized access to facilities. It can also serve aesthetic purposes, blending with the environment while maintaining its functionality. Proper maintenance and regular inspections are essential to ensure fencing remains effective over time.

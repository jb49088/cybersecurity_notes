# Statement of work (SOW)

[[üè∑Ô∏èBusiness agreement]]

A statement of work (SOW) is a formal document that outlines the scope, objectives, deliverables, and expectations for a project. It serves as an agreement between a client and a vendor, contractor, or service provider, ensuring that all parties understand the work to be completed, the timeline, and the required standards.

- **Project scope**: Defines what work will be performed, including tasks, services, and deliverables.
- **Objectives**: Specifies the goals and expected outcomes of the project.
- **Timeline**: Outlines deadlines, milestones, and the overall project schedule.
- **Roles and responsibilities**: Details the responsibilities of each party involved in the project.
- **Deliverables**: Lists the expected outputs, including reports, products, or services to be provided.
- **Standards and requirements**: Defines quality standards, compliance regulations, and any technical specifications.
- **Payment terms**: Specifies the cost of services, payment schedule, and any penalties for non-compliance.

A well-defined SOW reduces miscommunication, sets clear expectations, and serves as a reference throughout the project to ensure accountability and successful completion.

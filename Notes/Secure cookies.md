# Secure Cookies

Secure cookies are a type of HTTP cookie that can only be transmitted over secure HTTPS connections. This ensures that the cookie data is encrypted during transmission, protecting it from being intercepted by attackers on untrusted networks. Secure cookies are commonly used to store sensitive information, such as session tokens, login credentials, or user preferences.

# E-discovery

E-discovery, or electronic discovery, is the process of collecting, preparing, reviewing, interpreting, and producing electronic documents for legal proceedings. It plays a crucial role in obtaining data required for litigation or regulatory compliance.

- **Collect and prepare electronic documents:** E-discovery involves gathering relevant electronic documents that may be used as evidence in legal cases.
- **Data gathering for legal processes:** The process typically focuses on retrieving data, not analyzing intent or context.
- **Works with digital forensics:** E-discovery and digital forensics complement each other. For example, during e-discovery, a storage drive may be obtained, but the data is smaller than expected. Digital forensics experts can recover deleted data to ensure completeness.
- **No intent consideration:** E-discovery does not typically evaluate the intent behind actions but rather focuses on the facts and available data.

E-discovery is essential for managing digital evidence in legal contexts, ensuring that all relevant data is retrieved and properly handled.

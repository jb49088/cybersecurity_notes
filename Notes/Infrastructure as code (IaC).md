# Infrastructure as code (IaC)

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is a methodology for managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes. It allows organizations to define servers, networks, and applications in code, creating a consistent, repeatable process for deploying infrastructure.

IaC enables version control for infrastructure, similar to application code. Changes can be tracked, reviewed, and reverted, ensuring a reliable and auditable infrastructure management process. Once defined, the same code can be used to build multiple application instances, ensuring consistency across deployments.

This approach is fundamental in cloud computing, where automation and scalability are essential. By defining infrastructure as code, organizations can deploy perfect, repeatable environments every time, reducing errors and improving efficiency.

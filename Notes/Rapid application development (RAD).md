# Rapid application development (RAD)

Rapid application development (RAD) is a software development methodology that emphasizes quick prototyping, iterative design, and user feedback over traditional, rigid development cycles. RAD focuses on speed and flexibility, allowing developers to quickly create functional software while continuously refining it based on user input.

RAD is particularly useful for projects where requirements are subject to change, as it enables teams to adapt and improve the application throughout the development process.

- **Prototyping:** Develops working models early in the process to gather feedback and refine features.
- **Iterative development:** Breaks the project into small, manageable iterations, allowing continuous improvements.
- **User involvement:** Encourages frequent collaboration between developers and end-users to ensure the final product meets user needs.
- **Flexibility:** Adapts to changing requirements without major project delays.
- **Faster time to market:** Reduces development cycles by focusing on rapid delivery and incremental updates.

RAD is commonly used in web and mobile application development, where speed and adaptability are critical to success.

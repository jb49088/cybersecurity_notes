# Block cipher

A block cipher is a symmetric encryption method that processes data in fixed-size blocks, typically 64 or 128 bits, rather than one bit or byte at a time. It encrypts each block of plaintext using the same key to produce a corresponding block of ciphertext.

Block ciphers use algorithms based on substitution, permutation, and key mixing to ensure security. To handle data longer or shorter than the block size, block cipher modes of operation (such as ECB, CBC, and GCM) are used.

Popular block ciphers include AES, DES, and RC6. Due to their robustness and flexibility, block ciphers are widely employed in secure communications, file encryption, and digital signatures.

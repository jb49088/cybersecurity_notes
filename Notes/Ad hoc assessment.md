# Ad hoc assessment

Ad hoc assessments are situational risk evaluations performed as needed, often in response to specific events or concerns. They are not part of a formal, ongoing risk assessment process but serve to address immediate issues.

- **Triggered by specific events:** These assessments are typically initiated due to particular circumstances, such as emerging threats or leadership inquiries.
- **Temporary structure:** A committee or task force is often formed to carry out the assessment. Once the evaluation is complete, the group is disbanded.
- **Focused scope:** The assessment targets a specific risk or concern, rather than evaluating the organizationâ€™s overall risk posture.
- **No recurring process:** The ad hoc nature means there may be no need to revisit this specific risk unless circumstances change.

Ad hoc assessments provide flexibility and responsiveness, enabling organizations to address immediate concerns without committing to a formalized, ongoing process.

# List 

[[🏷️Data structure]]

In Python, list data is a data structure that consists of a collection of data in sequential form. Lists elements can be of any data type, such as strings, integers, Booleans, or even other lists. The elements of a list are placed within square brackets, and each element is separated by a comma. The following lists contains elements of various data types:

- `[12, 36, 54, 1, 7]`
- `["eraab", "arusso", "drosas"]`
- `[True, False, True, True]`
- `[15, "approved", True, 45.5, False]`
- `[]`

The last item `[]`, which doesn't contain anything within the brackets, is called an empty list.

## Displaying Strings

You can use the `print()` function to display a list. For example:

`print([12, 36, 54, 1, 7])`

Outputs:

`[12, 36, 54, 1, 7]`

This displays a list containing the integers `12`, `36`, `54`, `1`, and `7`.

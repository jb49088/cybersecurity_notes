# Bogus DNS 

Bogus DNS is a technique used to protect networks by deliberately providing false DNS information to mislead potential attackers or prevent them from reaching malicious destinations. This method can help defend against certain types of cyberattacks, like DNS spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks, by redirecting malicious traffic to harmless or non-existent addresses.

Organizations can use bogus DNS as part of their defense strategy, creating decoy domains or fake DNS responses to trap attackers and detect suspicious activity.

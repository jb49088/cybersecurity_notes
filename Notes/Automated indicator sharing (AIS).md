[[üè∑Ô∏èThreat intelligence]]

Automated indicator sharing (AIS) is a system designed to facilitate the exchange of cyber threat indicators and other related information between organizations, government entities, and cybersecurity providers. AIS helps improve the speed and efficiency of threat intelligence sharing, allowing organizations to respond more quickly to emerging cyber threats.

AIS enables the automated sharing of data such as malicious IP addresses, domain names, file hashes, URLs, and other indicators of compromise (IoCs) that are commonly used to identify cyberattacks. This system is typically integrated with security tools like intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and endpoint security solutions to ensure that new threat information is promptly acted upon.

Key benefits of AIS include:

- **Speed:** Automated sharing of IoCs ensures that organizations can receive and act on threat intelligence faster.
- **Collaboration:** Enhances cooperation between the public and private sectors, as well as among cybersecurity communities.
- **Proactive Defense:** With real-time access to threat intelligence, organizations can take preventive measures and respond proactively to threats.

AIS plays a crucial role in enhancing collective cybersecurity by allowing organizations to share critical threat data in real time, enabling faster identification and mitigation of cyberattacks.

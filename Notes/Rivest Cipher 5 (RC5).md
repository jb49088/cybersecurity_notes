# Rivest Cipher 5 (RC5)

[[üè∑Ô∏èSymmetric encryption algorithm]]

Rivest Cipher 5 (RC5) is a symmetric block cipher created by Ron Rivest in 1994. It is highly flexible, with variable block sizes (32, 64, or 128 bits), key lengths (up to 2,048 bits), and the number of encryption rounds. This adaptability allows RC5 to be tailored for different applications and security requirements.

RC5 uses a Feistel-like structure with modular addition, XOR, and bitwise rotations as its primary operations. Its simplicity and efficiency make it suitable for both hardware and software implementations.

Despite its strengths, RC5 has seen limited adoption compared to other block ciphers like AES, largely due to patent restrictions and advancements in cryptographic standards.

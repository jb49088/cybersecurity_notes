# Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2)

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork protocol]]

WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access II) was introduced in 2004 as the successor to [[Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)|WPA]] and is now the standard for securing Wi-Fi networks. It addressed some of the limitations of its predecessor and provided stronger security features.

**Key Features of WPA2:**

1. **AES Encryption**: WPA2 primarily uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is much more secure than the RC4 cipher used in WPA. AES provides stronger encryption and is widely regarded as highly secure.
   <br>
2. **CCMP (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol)**: WPA2 employs CCMP for encryption and integrity, ensuring that data packets are encrypted and tamper-proof.
   <br>
3. **Enhanced Authentication**: WPA2 continues to support both Pre-Shared Key (PSK) mode for personal networks and IEEE 802.1X for enterprise networks, enabling secure user authentication.
   <br>
4. **Robust Security Network (RSN)**: WPA2 includes the RSN feature, which ensures that only devices that support WPA2 can connect to the network, improving overall security.
   <br>
5. **Backward Compatibility**: WPA2 was designed to be backward compatible with WPA, allowing users to transition without losing connectivity with older devices.
    
WPA2 has become the standard for most Wi-Fi networks, and while it's more secure than its predecessors, vulnerabilities have been discovered over time. This led to the development of WPA3, which provides even more advanced security features, but WPA2 remains widely used today.

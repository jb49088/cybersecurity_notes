# Certificate revocation list (CRL)

A certificate revocation list (CRL) is a list maintained by a Certificate Authority (CA) that contains digital certificates that have been revoked before their expiration date. These revocations can occur for various reasons, such as a compromised private key or changes in the certificate holder's status.

CRLs are updated regularly and can grow in size as more certificates are revoked. They are used to ensure that clients and services do not trust certificates that are no longer valid, maintaining the integrity of secure communications.

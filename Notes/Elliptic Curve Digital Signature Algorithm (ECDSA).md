# Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)

Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is a cryptographic method used to generate and verify digital signatures. Based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), ECDSA provides strong security with shorter key sizes compared to traditional algorithms like RSA.

ECDSA is widely used in secure communication protocols, blockchain systems (e.g., Bitcoin), and digital certificates. It involves two main processes:

1. **Signature Generation:** A private key is used to create a unique digital signature for a given message.
   <br>
2. **Signature Verification:** The corresponding public key is used to confirm that the signature is valid and that the message has not been altered.

The efficiency and strength of ECDSA make it ideal for environments requiring secure, lightweight cryptographic operations, such as mobile devices and embedded systems.

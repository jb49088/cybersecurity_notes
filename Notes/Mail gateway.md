# Mail gateway

A mail gateway acts as the gatekeeper for email communication, providing a secure barrier between an organization's email system and the outside world. It evaluates incoming and outgoing messages to ensure security and compliance, preventing malicious or unwanted content from reaching end users.

- **The gatekeeper:** The mail gateway functions as the first line of defense, inspecting all inbound and outbound email traffic.
- **Evaluates the source of inbound email messages:** By analyzing sender information, headers, and other metadata, the gateway identifies suspicious or unauthorized emails.
- **Blocks it at the gateway before it reaches the user:** Potential threats like phishing attempts, spam, or malware-laden messages are stopped at the gateway, ensuring they do not reach the user's inbox.
- **On-site or cloud-based:** Mail gateways can be deployed as on-premises hardware or software, or as cloud-based solutions, providing flexibility to match the organizationâ€™s infrastructure and needs.

Mail gateways are essential for maintaining secure and efficient email communication, safeguarding against email-based threats, and supporting organizational compliance with regulatory requirements.

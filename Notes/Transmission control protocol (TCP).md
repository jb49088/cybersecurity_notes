# Transmission control protocol (TCP)

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork protocol]]

Transmission control protocol (TCP) is a core component of the Internet protocol suite, providing reliable, connection-oriented communication between devices over a network. It ensures data is delivered accurately and in the correct order.

- **Reliable data delivery:** TCP uses acknowledgments and retransmissions to guarantee that all data packets are successfully delivered to the destination.
- **Connection-oriented communication:** A TCP connection is established through a three-way handshake before data transfer begins, ensuring both devices are ready to communicate.
- **Ordered data transfer:** TCP numbers data packets to ensure they are reassembled in the correct order, regardless of the sequence in which they arrive.
- **Error checking:** TCP includes error detection mechanisms to identify and correct issues, ensuring data integrity during transmission.
- **Flow and congestion control:** TCP dynamically adjusts data transfer rates based on network conditions, avoiding overloading the network and ensuring efficient communication.

TCP is widely used for applications requiring reliable data transfer, such as web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP), and file transfers (FTP). Its robust features make it a cornerstone of modern networking.

# Server clustering

Server clustering is a technology that combines two or more servers into a unified system that appears and operates as a single large server. This setup enhances capacity, availability, and reliability, making it an essential feature in environments requiring high-performance computing or uninterrupted service. To end users, the cluster appears as a single device, abstracting the complexity of its multiple components.

One of the primary advantages of server clustering is its scalability. Additional servers can be added to the cluster as demand increases, providing a straightforward way to expand capacity without significant reconfiguration. Clustering also ensures high availability, as the failure of one server within the cluster can be mitigated by the others taking over its workload.

Server clusters are typically configured within the operating system, with all servers in the cluster using a common OS to ensure compatibility and smooth operation. This unified approach allows the cluster to function seamlessly as a cohesive unit, providing consistent performance and reliability.

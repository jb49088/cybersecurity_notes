The data plane, also known as the forwarding plane, is the component of a network or system responsible for the actual movement of data packets. It operates based on instructions received from the control plane.

Key features:

- **Traffic Handling:** Transmits data between devices or networks.
- **High Speed:** Optimized for fast, efficient data delivery.
- **Separation from Logic:** Relies on control plane directives without independent decision-making.

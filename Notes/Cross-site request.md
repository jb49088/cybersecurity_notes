# Cross-site request

Cross-site requests are common and legitimate in modern web browsing. For example, when you visit a website like ProfessorMesser.com, your browser may load text from the site, video content from YouTube, and images from Instagram. These requests are typically initiated by the HTML content on the webpage, directing the browser to retrieve resources from external sites.

This process is normal and expected, as many websites rely on resources from other domains. Most of these requests are unauthenticated, meaning they don't involve user-specific credentials or session data, making them easy for browsers to handle without any security concerns.

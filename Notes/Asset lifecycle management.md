[[üè∑Ô∏èRisk management]]

Asset lifecycle management is the process of managing an asset throughout its entire lifecycle, from acquisition to disposal. It ensures that assets are effectively monitored, maintained, and utilized to maximize their value, optimize performance, and reduce costs. This approach applies to hardware, software, data, and other organizational resources.

The stages of asset lifecycle management typically include:

- **Planning:** Identifying the need for an asset and determining its requirements and budget.
- **Acquisition:** Procuring or deploying the asset through purchase, lease, or development.
- **Deployment:** Installing and integrating the asset into the operational environment.
- **Operation and Maintenance:** Monitoring, maintaining, and optimizing the asset to ensure reliability and performance.
- **Retirement/Disposal:** Decommissioning the asset at the end of its useful life, including data sanitization and proper disposal.

Asset lifecycle management helps organizations:

- **Reduce Costs:** Extend asset lifespan and optimize resource usage.
- **Enhance Security:** Identify and decommission obsolete or vulnerable assets.
- **Ensure Compliance:** Track assets to meet regulatory and audit requirements.

Automated tools, such as asset management software, are often used to streamline lifecycle management processes and maintain visibility over all assets.

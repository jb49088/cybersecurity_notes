# Bandwidth

The capacity of a connection. How much [[Data|data]] can be transmitted over a [[Network|network]] or internet connection at a time, measured in bits per second (bps) and its higher multiples like kilobits per second (Kbps), megabits per second (Mbps), and gigabits per second (Gbps). You can calculate bandwidth by dividing the quantity of data by the time inÂ seconds.

# OpenID

OpenID is an open standard for decentralized authentication. OpenID identity providers can be leveraged for third-party sites using established identities. A common example of this is the “Log in with Google” functionality that many websites provide, but Google is not the only example of a major OpenID identity provider. Microsoft, Amazon, and many other organizations are OpenID identity providers (IdPs). Relying parties (RPs) redirect authentication requests to the IdP and then receive a response with an assertion that the user is who they claim to be due to successful authentication, and the user is logged in using the OpenID for that user.

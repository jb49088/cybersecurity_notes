# Asset tracking

Asset tracking involves maintaining a detailed inventory of all physical and digital assets within an organization to ensure accurate management, security, and lifecycle monitoring.

- Inventory every asset, including laptops, desktops, servers, routers, switches, cables, fiber modules, tablets, and more.
- Associate a support ticket with each device's make and model to provide more precise details than a userâ€™s description.
- Perform enumeration to list all parts of an asset, such as the CPU, memory, storage drive, keyboard, and mouse.
- Add an asset tag for identification, using methods like barcodes, RFID, visible tracking numbers, or including the organization name. Asset tags also aid in media sanitization and disposal processes.

Effective asset tracking ensures efficient resource management, streamlined troubleshooting, and enhanced security.

[[🏷️Malware]] 

Adware is a type of malware that automatically displays or downloads advertisements on a user's computer or device. While not inherently malicious like other types of malware, adware can be intrusive and disruptive to the user experience, often leading to unwanted pop-up ads, browser redirects, and changes in browser settings.

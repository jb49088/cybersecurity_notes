# False flag attack

A false flag Attack is a deceptive operation designed to mislead or confuse the origin of a particular action or event, often in the context of cyber warfare, espionage, or terrorism. The attacker intentionally carries out an attack in such a way that it appears to be the work of another entity or group. This tactic is frequently used to provoke a reaction, shift blame, or manipulate public perception.

In cybersecurity, a False Flag Attack may involve the use of tools, techniques, or digital footprints that resemble those of a specific hacker group, nation-state, or organization, leading investigators or defenders to wrongly attribute the attack to them. The goal is often to create chaos, sow distrust, or achieve political or strategic advantages.

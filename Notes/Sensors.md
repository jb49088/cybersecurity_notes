[[üè∑Ô∏èPhysical security]]

Sensors are devices used in physical security systems to detect changes in the environment and trigger alerts or actions in response. They play a crucial role in intrusion detection, monitoring perimeters, and safeguarding critical assets. Different types of sensors are employed depending on the specific security requirements and environmental conditions, each with unique capabilities and applications.

## Types of sensors used in security:

- **Infrared sensors:** Detect heat emitted by objects, making them effective for identifying human or animal movement. They are commonly used in motion detectors for indoor and outdoor security.
- **Pressure sensors:** React to changes in weight or force, often embedded in floors or mats to detect unauthorized movement or access.
- **Microwave sensors:** Use microwave signals to create a detection zone. They sense movement within the zone and are highly effective in open or outdoor areas.
- **Ultrasonic sensors:** Emit high-frequency sound waves and detect changes in their reflection caused by movement. They are often used in enclosed spaces for precise motion detection.

These sensors are often integrated into broader security systems, such as alarm systems, surveillance cameras, and access controls, to provide a layered approach to security. Proper placement and calibration of sensors are essential to minimize false alarms and ensure reliable detection.

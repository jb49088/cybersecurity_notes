# Key management system (KMS)

A key management system (KMS) is a system used to securely generate, store, manage, and track encryption keys throughout their lifecycle. KMS ensures that keys are kept safe, rotated regularly, and associated with the appropriate users and resources. Key management is crucial for maintaining the security of encrypted data and preventing unauthorized access.

KMS can be deployed in two main ways:

- **On-Premise KMS:** These systems are hosted within an organization's infrastructure, giving the organization full control over key management and security policies.
- **Cloud-Based KMS:** Cloud service providers offer key management systems as a service, enabling businesses to store and manage keys in the cloud with scalable security features.

A key feature of KMS is the ability to centralize key management, which simplifies control, auditing, and enforcement of security policies across an organization. This system can associate keys with specific users or applications, ensuring that only authorized entities can access certain encrypted data.

KMS also supports key rotation, the process of regularly changing encryption keys to limit the impact of potential key compromise. This ensures that even if a key is compromised, its usefulness is minimized over time. Additionally, KMS systems typically log key use, tracking when and by whom keys are accessed, along with other critical information such as expiration and rotation events.

By managing keys securely and centrally, KMS helps organizations maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their sensitive data.

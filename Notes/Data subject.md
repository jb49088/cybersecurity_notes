# Data subject

A data subject is any individual whose personal data is collected, processed, or stored. Essentially, it refers to anyone who can be identified or whose information can be linked to a specific person.

- **Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person**: A data subject is an individual whose personal data—such as their name, identification number, contact details, genetic data, physical traits, or location—can be used to identify them.
- **This includes everyone**: Every person who provides personal data, whether directly or indirectly, is a data subject. This includes a wide range of personal details, from basic contact information to sensitive data like genetic makeup or physical characteristics.
- **Laws and regulations**: Privacy laws and regulations, like the GDPR, are primarily structured around the rights and protections of the data subject. These laws ensure that individuals have control over their personal information and how it is used by organizations.
    
The concept of the data subject is central to data protection and privacy laws, aiming to ensure that individuals' rights are respected and their personal data is handled securely.

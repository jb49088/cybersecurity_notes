A work order (WO) is a document that authorizes and details specific tasks to be performed, often in maintenance, service, or project-based work. It provides instructions on the scope of work, resources required, and expected completion time, ensuring that tasks are executed efficiently and according to requirements.

- **Assigned personnel**: Identifies the individual, team, or contractor responsible for completing the work.
- **Materials and resources**: Lists any tools, equipment, or materials needed.
- **Priority level**: Indicates the urgency of the task.
- **Start and completion dates**: Defines when the work should begin and be completed.

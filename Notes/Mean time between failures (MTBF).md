# Mean time between failures (MTBF)

[[üè∑Ô∏èRisk management]]

Mean time between failures (MTBF) is a key metric used to predict the reliability of a system or component. It measures the average time between failures of a system during operation. MTBF is typically used for repairable systems and helps estimate how long a system will function before it is likely to experience a failure.

MTBF is calculated by dividing the total operating time by the number of failures that occur during that period. A higher MTBF indicates greater reliability, suggesting that the system or component has a longer period of operational time between failures. Organizations often use MTBF to schedule maintenance and plan for equipment replacements.

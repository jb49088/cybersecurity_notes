# Address space layout randomization (ASLR)

Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is a security technique used to prevent attackers from predicting the memory addresses used by processes in a system. By randomly arranging the memory address space of a process, ASLR makes it significantly harder for an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow attacks, where an attacker tries to execute malicious code at a known address.

ASLR works by randomizing the locations of key data areas in memory, such as the stack, heap, and libraries, each time a process is executed. This randomness ensures that even if an attacker successfully exploits a vulnerability in the program, they will be unable to predict where in memory their malicious code or payload is likely to land.

Key benefits of ASLR include:

- **Increased Security:** By randomizing memory addresses, ASLR makes it more difficult for attackers to predict the location of critical parts of memory, preventing exploit attempts.
- **Defense in Depth:** ASLR adds another layer of protection to systems, making it harder for attackers to succeed even if they manage to find other vulnerabilities.
- **Compatibility:** Most modern operating systems and applications support ASLR, providing strong security without requiring significant changes to software.

However, ASLR is not foolproof, and advanced attackers may be able to bypass it using techniques such as information leaks or brute force attacks. Despite its limitations, ASLR is an important tool in mitigating specific types of memory-related vulnerabilities and enhancing overall system security.

# Recovery testing

Recovery testing is a crucial aspect of disaster recovery planning, where organizations test their systems and processes to ensure they can recover from a disaster or disruptive event. This proactive approach helps identify potential weaknesses and ensure that response protocols are effective when an actual incident occurs.

It's important to conduct recovery tests before a real event takes place, usually through scheduled update sessions such as annual or semi-annual tests. During these tests, well-defined rules of engagement should be in place to ensure that the production systems are not impacted.

The recovery testing process typically involves simulating a very specific disaster scenario, often with a limited time to execute the recovery. After the test, the response is evaluated, and the results are documented and discussed. This review provides insights into the effectiveness of the recovery plan and identifies areas for improvement.

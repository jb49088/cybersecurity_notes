# HMAC-based one-time password (HOTP)

HMAC-based one-time password (HOTP) is an authentication mechanism used to generate a one-time password (OTP) based on the HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) algorithm. It provides a secure method for verifying the identity of users in two-factor authentication (2FA) systems.

- **OTP generation:** HOTP generates a unique password by applying an HMAC function to a secret key and a counter. Each time an OTP is requested, the counter is incremented, ensuring that the password is only valid once.
- **Security:** HOTP relies on the strength of the cryptographic hash function and the shared secret key, which only the server and the user possess. This prevents the reuse of passwords and protects against replay attacks.
- **No time dependency:** Unlike time-based OTPs (TOTP), HOTP does not rely on synchronized clocks. Instead, it uses a counter, making it more resilient to issues related to time synchronization between the client and server.
- **Implementation:** HOTP is commonly used in conjunction with physical tokens or mobile apps that generate OTPs. These systems often provide users with a new code each time they need to authenticate.
- **Expiration and use:** The OTP generated by HOTP typically expires after a single use. If a user attempts to use the same OTP again, the authentication will fail.

HOTP is a secure and reliable method for providing an additional layer of authentication, especially in environments where time-based synchronization is challenging.

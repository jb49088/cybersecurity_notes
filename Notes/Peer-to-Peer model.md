# Peer-to-Peer

In a peer-to-peer network, the computers act as both service providers and service requestors. An example of a peer-to-peer resource model is shown in Figure 2.24.

The peer-to-peer model is great for small, simple, inexpensive networks. This model can be set up almost instantly, with little extra hardware required. Many versions of Windows (Windows 11, Windows 10, and others) as well as Linux and macOS are popular operating system environments that support the peer-to-peer resource model. Peer-to-peer networks are also referred to as workgroups.

Generally speaking, there is no centralized administration or control in the peer-to-peer resource model. Every workstation has unique control over the resources that the computer owns, and each workstation must be administered separately. However, this very lack of centralized control can make administering the network difficult; for the same reason, the network isn’t very secure. Each user needs to manage separate passwords for each computer on which they wish to access resources, as well as set up and manage the shared resources on their own computer. Moreover, because each computer is acting as both a workstation and a server, it may not be easy to locate resources. The person who is in charge of a file may have moved it without anyone’s knowledge. Also, the users who work under this arrangement need more training because they are not only users but also administrators.

Will this type of network meet the needs of the organization today and in the future? Peer-to-peer resource models are generally considered the right choice for small companies that don’t expect future growth. Small companies that expect growth, on the other hand, should not choose this type of model.

# Identity provider (IdP)

An identity provider (IdP) is a service or system that manages and authenticates user identities and provides authorization information to other services or applications. The IdP stores user credentials and is responsible for validating user identity before granting access to protected resources.

- **Authentication service:** The IdP handles the process of authenticating users, typically through methods like username/password, biometrics, or multi-factor authentication (MFA), ensuring only authorized users can access services.
- **Single sign-on (SSO):** IdPs often facilitate Single Sign-On, allowing users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications or services without needing to log in separately for each one.
- **Security protocols:** IdPs support industry-standard authentication protocols such as SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language), OAuth, and OpenID Connect, enabling secure communication between the IdP and service providers.
- **User management:** The IdP is responsible for storing user information, managing roles and permissions, and ensuring that only users with the appropriate access rights can perform specific actions.
- **Federation:** IdPs enable identity federation, allowing users from different domains or organizations to authenticate and access services across various systems or platforms.

By centralizing authentication, IdPs improve user convenience and enhance security while reducing the management overhead of maintaining separate credentials for each service.

[[üè∑Ô∏èAsymmetric encryption algorithm]]

Rivest shamir adleman (RSA) is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm that enables secure data transmission and digital signatures. It is based on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers and is named after its inventors, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman.

RSA works by generating a pair of keys: a public key, which can be shared openly, and a private key, which is kept secret. The encryption process uses the recipient's public key to encrypt data, while the corresponding private key is used to decrypt it. This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the encrypted data. RSA is also used for digital signatures, where the sender uses their private key to sign a message, and the recipient verifies it using the sender's public key.

While RSA is highly secure, it is relatively slow compared to symmetric encryption algorithms and is typically used for key exchange or digital signatures rather than bulk data encryption.

# Serverless architecture

Serverless architecture is a cloud computing model where applications are broken down into individual, autonomous functions, often referred to as Function as a Service (FaaS). This model abstracts the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus solely on creating and deploying code without managing servers or operating systems.

Functions in a serverless environment typically run in stateless compute containers. These containers may be triggered by specific events, such as API requests or database updates, and are often ephemeral, running only for the duration of the event. This event-driven nature allows for efficient resource utilization and scalability.

The serverless model is managed by a third-party provider, which assumes responsibility for operating system security, updates, and maintenance. Developers can focus entirely on building server-side logic without worrying about infrastructure management.

[[üè∑Ô∏èRegulation]]

The General data protection regulation (GDPR) is a European Union regulation designed to protect the privacy and personal data of individuals within the EU. It sets strict guidelines for the collection, processing, and storage of personal data to ensure privacy rights are upheld.

- **European Union regulation**: The GDPR applies to all entities operating within the EU and any organization that processes data of EU citizens. It governs the protection of various personal data types, such as names, addresses, photos, email addresses, medical information, and even online identifiers like IP addresses.
- **Controls export of personal data**: The regulation allows users to have control over where their data is shared. Individuals can request the removal of their data from search engine results or demand that it not be transferred outside the EU.
- **Gives ‚Äúdata subjects‚Äù control of their personal data**: The GDPR empowers individuals with the "right to be forgotten," meaning they can request the deletion of their personal data from systems where it‚Äôs stored, subject to certain conditions.

The GDPR aims to give individuals more control over their personal data and how it is used, while ensuring that organizations handle this data with the highest levels of security and privacy.

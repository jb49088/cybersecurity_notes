# Standard

A standard is a set of established guidelines or specifications that define how certain processes, products, or services should be designed, performed, or measured. Standards are commonly used in various industries, including technology, engineering, manufacturing, and communications, to ensure consistency, quality, and safety.

Standards can be created by organizations such as international standard bodies (e.g., ISO, IEEE) or industry-specific groups. They help ensure interoperability, reliability, and adherence to best practices.

Standards can be used to:

- Provide a uniform approach to processes and systems.
- Ensure products and services meet quality and safety requirements.
- Foster compatibility between different technologies and systems.
- Promote efficiency by minimizing variations.

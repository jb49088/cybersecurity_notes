# Access Restrictions

Access restrictions are security measures that limit the ability of individuals or systems to access sensitive information or resources. Two common types of access restrictions are geographic restrictions and permission restrictions: 

- **Geographic restrictions:** limit access to resources based on the physical location of the user or system. For example, an organization may restrict access to a database to only those users located within a certain country or region. This can help to prevent unauthorized access from outside of the organization's trusted network. 

- **Permission restrictions:** limit access to resources based on the user's role or level of authorization. For example, a company may grant access to financial data only to authorized personnel who have undergone appropriate background checks and training. 

By implementing access restrictions, organizations can ensure that sensitive information and resources are only accessible to authorized individuals and systems, minimizing the risk of data breaches and cyberattacks.

# Multifunction device (MFD)

A multifunction device (MFD) is a piece of hardware that integrates multiple functions into a single unit, commonly combining capabilities such as printing, scanning, copying, and faxing. Unlike a multifunction printer (MFP), which specifically focuses on print-related tasks, an MFD can include additional functionalities beyond document handling, such as telephony, networking, or data storage.

- **Versatility:** MFDs may include printing and scanning but can also incorporate features like document storage, communication tools, or workflow automation.
- **Office integration:** Often used in business environments where multiple functions need to be centralized within a single device.
- **Network connectivity:** Many MFDs support Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and cloud-based services for seamless integration into digital workflows.
- **Security features:** Because MFDs handle sensitive data, they often include security measures such as encrypted storage, access controls, and audit logging.
- **Efficiency and cost savings:** Consolidating multiple devices into one reduces space usage, power consumption, and maintenance costs.

MFDs are commonly used in workplaces that require a combination of office functions beyond printing, offering a streamlined solution for managing documents, communication, and digital workflows.

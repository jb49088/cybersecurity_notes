# Tabletop exercise

A tabletop exercise is a discussion-based simulation where team members walk through the steps of responding to a hypothetical incident or crisis scenario. It’s designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an organization’s response plans, identify gaps, and improve coordination among different departments.

- **Scenario planning**: Participants are presented with a realistic scenario, such as a data breach, natural disaster, or cyberattack, and asked to discuss their responses.
- **Role-playing**: Each participant assumes their actual role within the organization, simulating decision-making and communication processes.
- **Evaluation and feedback**: The exercise ends with a debriefing session where strengths and weaknesses in the response are discussed, and action items are identified to improve the plan.
- **Regular practice**: Conducting tabletop exercises regularly helps keep response teams prepared and ensures that response plans stay current and effective.

Tabletop exercises are valuable for enhancing preparedness, strengthening team communication, and ensuring everyone understands their roles during an actual incident.

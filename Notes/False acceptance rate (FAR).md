# False acceptance rate (FAR)

The false acceptance rate (FAR) is a performance metric used in biometric systems that measures the likelihood of an unauthorized user being incorrectly granted access. It refers to the probability that the system will falsely accept a biometric input that does not match the enrolled data. In simpler terms, FAR indicates how often a system mistakenly recognizes an unauthorized individual as a valid user.

FAR is an important factor when designing and evaluating biometric systems, as it directly impacts security. A higher FAR means the system is more vulnerable to allowing unauthorized users, compromising security. To maintain a high level of security, it's crucial to minimize the FAR, ensuring that only legitimate users are granted access.

However, minimizing FAR often comes at the cost of increasing the false rejection rate (FRR), where legitimate users may be incorrectly denied access. Therefore, finding an optimal balance between FAR and FRR is key to maintaining both security and user convenience.

FAR is typically adjusted by fine-tuning the sensitivity of the biometric system. For instance, a more stringent threshold for matching biometric data may reduce FAR, but this could also increase FRR, leading to more false rejections.

# OAuth

OAuth is an authorization framework that enables secure, third-party access to a user's resources without sharing their credentials. It allows users to grant access to specific data or actions without exposing their passwords.

- **Authorization framework:** OAuth determines which resources a user can access, granting limited access to third-party applications.
- **Created by major tech companies:** Developed by companies like Twitter, Google, and others, OAuth has widespread industry support.
- **Not an authentication protocol:** OAuth is not designed for authentication. OpenID Connect is typically used for authentication, while OAuth handles authorization.
- **Widely used:** OAuth is employed by major platforms such as Twitter, Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn to manage permissions and secure access to user data.

OAuth provides a robust solution for managing secure authorization in applications without compromising user credentials.

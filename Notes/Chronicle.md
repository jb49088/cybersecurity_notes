# Chronicle

A [[Cloudnative|cloudnative]] [[30-39 Educational/38 Incident Response & Forensics/0 Meta/Archive/Security information and event management (SIEM)|Security information and event management (SIEM)]] tool from Google designed to retain, analyze, and search [[Log data|log data]] to identify [[Risk management|risks]]. [[Cyber Threats|threats]], and [[Vulnerability|vulnerabilities]]. It has [[Filtering|filters]] to sort [[Log data|log data]] by a specific [[Asset Management|asset]], [[Domain|domain]] name, [[User|user]], or [[IP address|IP address]].

Chronicle allow [[User|users]] to review an organization's data on the following [[Visual dashboard|dashboards]].

### Chronicle dashboards

#### Main dashboard

The main [[Visual dashboard|dashboard]] displays a high-level summary of information related to the organization’s data ingestion, alerting, and event activity over time. This dashboard can be used to access a timeline of security events—such as a spike in failed login attempts— to identify [[Cyber Threats|threats]] trends across log sources, devices, [[IP address|IP addresses]], and physical locations.

#### IOC matches dashboard

This [[Visual dashboard|dashboard]] indicates the top [[Cyber Threats|threats]], [[Risk management|risks]], and [[Vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] to the organization. Security professionals use it to observe [[Domain|domain]] names, [[IP address|IP addresses]], and device [[Indicators of compromise (IoC)|IoCs]] over time in order to identify trends. This information is then used to direct the security team’s focus to the highest priority [[Cyber Threats|threats]]. For example, this dashboard can be used to search for additional activity associated with an alert, such as a suspicious [[User|user]] login from an unusual geographic location.

#### Rule detections dashboard

This [[Visual dashboard|dashboard]] provides statistics related to [[main/Incident Response & Forensics|incidents]] with the highest occurrences, severities, and detections over time. This [[Visual dashboard|dashboard]] can be used to access a list of all the alerts triggered by a specific detection rule, such as a rule designed to alert whenever a [[User|user]] opens a known malicious attachment from an email. These statistics help manage recurring incidents and establish mitigation tactics to reduce an organization's level of [[Risk management|risk]].

#### User sign in overview dashboard

This [[Visual dashboard|dashboard]] provides information about [[User|user]] access behavior across the organization. This dashboard can be used to access a list of all [[User|user]] signin events to identify unusual [[User|user]] activity, such as a [[User|user]] signing in from multiple locations at the same time. This information is then used to help mitigate [[Cyber Threats|threats]], [[Risk management|risks]], and [[Vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] to user accounts and the organization’s applications.

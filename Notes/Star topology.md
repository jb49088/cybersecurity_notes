# Star topology

[[🏷️Network topology]]

A star topology (also called a hub-and-spoke topology) branches each network device off a central device called a hub or a switch, making it easy to add a new workstation. If a workstation goes down, it does not affect the entire network; if the central device goes down, the entire network goes with it. Because of this, the hub (or switch) is called a single point of failure. Figure 2.27 shows a simple star network.

> [!info] Note 
> Although the switch is the central portion of a star topology, some older networks use a device known as a hub instead of a switch. Switches are more advanced than hubs, and they provide better performance than hubs for only a small price increase. Colloquially, though, many administrators use the terms hub and switch interchangeably.

Cybersecurity insurance is a type of coverage designed to protect organizations from financial losses resulting from cyberattacks, data breaches, and other security incidents. It can help cover various costs associated with a breach, such as recovery and legal expenses.

Key points about cybersecurity insurance include:

- **Coverage areas:** Cybersecurity insurance can cover lost revenue, data recovery costs, funds lost to phishing attacks, and privacy lawsuit expenses.
- **Limitations:** It doesnâ€™t cover everything, such as intentional acts, fraudulent fund transfers, or negligence-related losses.
- **Increased demand:** The rise of ransomware attacks has driven more organizations to invest in cybersecurity liability insurance, recognizing its importance across all sectors.

Cybersecurity insurance helps organizations mitigate financial risks associated with cyber threats, but it is important to understand its limitations and exclusions.

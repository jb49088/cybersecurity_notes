# Application security monitoring

Application security monitoring involves tracking and analyzing application activity to identify potential security threats and ensure the application operates securely. It provides valuable insights into real-time activity, blocked threats, and unusual behavior.

Key aspects of application security monitoring:

- Real-time information is collected, including details on application usage and access demographics, to understand how the application is being used.
- Blocked attacks, such as SQL injection attempts or exploitation of patched vulnerabilities, are logged for review and analysis.
- Logs are audited to uncover hidden threats or information-gathering attempts that might indicate a planned attack.
- Anomaly detection identifies unusual activities, such as unexpected file transfers or a sudden increase in client access, which could signal a potential security issue.

By monitoring application security, organizations can proactively address vulnerabilities, detect and respond to threats, and maintain the integrity of their applications.

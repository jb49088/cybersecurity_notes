# Honeypot

A honeypot is a cybersecurity technique designed to lure attackers by creating a decoy system, network, or application that mimics legitimate systems but is isolated and monitored for malicious activity. Honeypots are intentionally vulnerable and appear attractive to cybercriminals, who attempt to exploit them. The purpose of a honeypot is to gather intelligence about attack methods, identify vulnerabilities, and divert attackers from more critical systems.

By monitoring and analyzing the activities of attackers within a honeypot, security professionals can identify emerging threats, improve defenses, and understand attacker behavior without directly impacting the real systems.

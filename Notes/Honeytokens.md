# Honeytokens

A honeytoken is a cybersecurity technique that involves embedding decoy data or credentials within a system, application, or network. These tokens are designed to attract attackers by appearing as valuable or legitimate information, such as fake usernames, passwords, API keys, or sensitive files. When an attacker attempts to use or steal a honeytoken, security teams are alerted to the unauthorized access or malicious activity.

Honeytokens are often used as part of a broader strategy to detect and monitor breaches or unauthorized activity within systems. Unlike honeypots, which focus on decoy systems or applications, honeytokens can be placed directly within real environments, making them harder for attackers to distinguish from genuine assets.

The primary benefit of honeytokens is that they allow organizations to track attacker behavior, identify compromised accounts, or detect data exfiltration attempts early. They provide valuable insights into attacker tactics, helping organizations strengthen defenses and minimize the risk of real data theft or system compromise.

# Graphical user interface (GUI)

A graphical user interface (GUI) is a visual-based interface that allows users to interact with a system through graphical elements such as windows, icons, buttons, and menus. Unlike command line interfaces (CLIs), which require users to type commands, GUIs provide an intuitive and accessible way to navigate and control software using a mouse, touchscreen, or other input devices.

- **User-friendly design**: GUIs are designed for ease of use, making computing accessible to users without technical expertise.
- **Visual elements**: Common components include windows, icons, buttons, dropdown menus, and toolbars that simplify interaction.
- **Multi-tasking support**: Allows users to run multiple applications simultaneously, with the ability to switch between open windows.
- **Widespread adoption**: Found in operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux desktop environments (GNOME, KDE), as well as in applications, websites, and mobile devices.
- **Touchscreen compatibility**: Many modern GUIs are optimized for touch-based interactions, commonly seen in smartphones, tablets, and kiosks.
    

GUIs enhance usability by making digital interactions more intuitive, but they may require more system resources compared to text-based CLIs.

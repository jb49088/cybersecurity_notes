# Influence Campaigns

[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

Influence campaigns are coordinated efforts to manipulate public opinion, behaviors, or beliefs through various forms of media, often to achieve political, social, or economic objectives. These campaigns typically rely on a combination of disinformation, propaganda, targeted messaging, and psychological manipulation. The goal is to shape public perception or influence decision-making processes in favor of specific interests, often without the awareness of the targeted individuals or groups.

These campaigns are often conducted by state actors, political organizations, corporations, or interest groups with the intention of influencing elections, public policy, or consumer behavior. While they can have significant effects on democracy and society, they are also increasingly being recognized as threats to the integrity of information and public trust.

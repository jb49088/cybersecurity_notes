# Session Timeout

Session timeout is a security feature used to automatically end a user's session after a specified period of inactivity. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access if a user leaves their device unattended or forgets to log out. When the session timeout period is reached, the user is typically logged out or required to re-authenticate before continuing their activity.

Session timeouts are especially important for protecting sensitive information in web applications, online banking, and other environments where security is crucial. A well-implemented session timeout policy ensures that even if a session is hijacked or forgotten, an attacker will have limited time to exploit it.

To enhance security, session timeouts should be combined with other measures, such as secure cookies, encryption, and multi-factor authentication (MFA). The optimal timeout duration varies depending on the sensitivity of the application and user behavior but generally ranges from 10 minutes to an hour of inactivity.

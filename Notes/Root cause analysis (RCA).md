# Root cause analysis (RCA)

Root cause analysis (RCA) is a methodical approach used to identify the underlying cause(s) of a problem or issue. It focuses on finding the root cause, rather than just addressing the symptoms, to ensure that corrective actions are effective and long-lasting. RCA is commonly used in problem-solving, incident management, and continuous improvement processes across various industries.

- **Define the problem**: Clearly identify the issue or event that needs investigation, and gather all relevant data.
- **Collect data**: Analyze existing records, logs, and observations to understand the scope and context of the issue.
- **Identify possible causes**: Look at potential contributing factors, such as human error, system failure, process flaws, or environmental factors.
- **Analyze root causes**: Use techniques like the "5 Whys" or fishbone diagrams (Ishikawa) to drill down into the underlying causes.
- **Implement corrective actions**: Based on the identified root causes, develop and implement measures to prevent recurrence.
- **Monitor and review**: Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of corrective actions and make adjustments as needed.

RCA helps organizations solve problems at their core, leading to more effective solutions, reduced downtime, and improved processes over time.

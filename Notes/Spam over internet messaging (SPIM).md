# Spam over internet messaging (SPIM)

Spam over internet messaging (SPIM) refers to the practice of sending unsolicited, usually irrelevant or harmful, messages through instant messaging (IM) platforms. Similar to email spam, SPIM is typically used for advertising, phishing attempts, or spreading malware.

As IM services have become a popular communication tool, SPIM has emerged as a growing concern for both individuals and organizations, leading to the implementation of various filters and security measures to mitigate its effects.

- **Unsolicited messages:** SPIM involves sending messages that the recipient did not request, often for commercial purposes.
- **Phishing and scams:** Many SPIM messages are designed to deceive users into revealing personal information or downloading malicious software.
- **Impact on user experience:** SPIM can overwhelm users with unwanted messages, leading to distractions, security risks, and potential loss of privacy.
- **Automated bots:** Spammers often use automated bots to send large volumes of messages quickly, making it difficult for users to manage.
- **Filtering and blocking:** IM platforms implement various measures, such as spam filters and blacklists, to detect and block SPIM.

SPIM is a form of cyber threat that can disrupt communication, expose users to scams, and compromise security. Awareness and protection against SPIM are essential for safe use of messaging platforms.

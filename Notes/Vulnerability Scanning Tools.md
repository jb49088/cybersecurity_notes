# Vulnerability Scanning Tools

As you develop your cybersecurity toolkit, you will want to have a network vulnerability scanner, an application scanner, and a web application scanner available for use. Vulnerability scanners are often leveraged for preventive scanning and testing and are also found in penetration testers toolkits, where they help identify systems that testers can exploit. This fact also means they're a favorite tool of attackers!

## Infrastructure Vulnerability Scanning

Network vulnerability scanners are capable of probing a wide range of network-connected devices for known vulnerabilities. They reach out to any systems connected to the network, attempt to determine the type of device and its configuration, and then launch targeted tests designed to detect the presence of any known vulnerabilities on those devices.

The following tools are examples of network vulnerability scanners:

- **Tenable's Nessus** is a well-known and widely respected network vulnerability scanning product that was one of the earliest products in this field.
- **Qualys vulnerability scanner** is a more recently developed commercial network vulnerability scanner that offers a unique deployment model using a software-as-a-service (SaaS) management console to run scans using appliances located both in on-premises datacenters and in the cloud.
- **Rapid7's Nexpose** is another commercial vulnerability management system that offers capabilities similar to those of Nessus and Qualys.
- The open source **OpenVAS** offers a free alternative to commercial vulnerability scanners.

These are four of the most commonly used network vulnerability scanners. Many other products are on the market today, and every mature organization should have at least one scanner in its toolkit. Many organizations choose to deploy two different vulnerability scanning products in the same environment as a defense-in-depth control.

## Application Testing

Application testing tools are commonly used as part of the software development process. These tools analyze custom-developed software to identify common security vulnerabilities. Application testing occurs using three techniques:

- **Static testing** analyzes code without executing it. This approach points developers directly at vulnerabilities and often provides specific remediation suggestions.
- **Dynamic testing** executes code as part of the test, running all the interfaces that the code exposes to the user with a variety of inputs, searching for vulnerabilities.
- **Interactive testing** combines static and dynamic testing, analyzing the source code while testers interact with the application through exposed interfaces.

Application tasting should be an integral part of the software development process. Many organizations introduce testing requirements into the software release process, requiring clean tests before releasing code into production.

## Web Application Scanning

Web application vulnerability scanners are specialized tools used to examine the security of web applications. These tools test for web- specific vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities. They work by combining traditional network scans of web servers with detailed probing of web applications using such techniques as sending known malicious input sequences and fuzzing in attempts to break the application.

Nikto is a popular web application scanning tool. It is an open source tool that is freely available for anyone to use. As shown in Image 2.49, it uses a command-line interface and is somewhat difficult to use.

Another open source tool available for web application scanning is Arachni. This tool, shown in Figure 2.50, is a packaged scanner available for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

Most organizations do use web application scanners, but they choose to use commercial products that offer advanced capabilities and user- friendly interfaces. Although there are dedicated web application scanners, such as Acunetix, on the market, many firms use the web application scanning capabilities of traditional network vulnerability scanners, such as Nessus, Qualys, and Nexpose.

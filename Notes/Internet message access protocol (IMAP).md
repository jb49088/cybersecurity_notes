[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork protocol]]

Internet message access protocol (IMAP) is an email retrieval protocol that allows users to access and manage their emails directly on a mail server, keeping messages synchronized across multiple devices.

- **Port number and protocol type:** IMAP operates over port 143 using TCP, and port 993 when using IMAP over SSL/TLS for encrypted communication.
- **Email synchronization:** Unlike POP, IMAP keeps emails stored on the server, allowing users to access their messages from multiple devices while maintaining consistency.
- **Folder management:** IMAP supports organizing emails into folders, marking messages as read/unread, and flagging them for importance‚Äîall changes are reflected across all connected devices.
- **Partial download:** IMAP allows users to download only email headers first, reducing bandwidth usage and enabling selective message retrieval.
- **Security features:** IMAP supports authentication mechanisms like OAuth and TLS encryption for secure email communication.

IMAP is widely used in modern email services due to its ability to provide a seamless and consistent email experience across multiple devices.

# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and perform tasks that typically require human cognition. AI systems use algorithms and data to analyze information, recognize patterns, make decisions, and improve their performance over time.

AI can be categorized into two main types:

- **Narrow AI:** AI systems designed for specific tasks, such as voice assistants, recommendation systems, or autonomous vehicles.
- **General AI:** Hypothetical AI that can perform any intellectual task a human can, exhibiting reasoning, problem-solving, and learning capabilities across domains.

Common AI techniques include:

- **Machine Learning (ML):** Algorithms that allow systems to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
- **Computer Vision:** Teaching machines to interpret and analyze visual information from the world.

AI is applied across numerous fields, such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, cybersecurity, and customer service, providing automation, efficiency, and innovation. While AI offers significant benefits, it also raises concerns regarding ethics, job displacement, and privacy.

# Extensible authentication protocol (EAP)

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork protocol]]

Extensible authentication protocol (EAP) is a flexible authentication framework used in network access protocols. Rather than being a single authentication method, EAP provides a structure that supports various authentication mechanisms, allowing customization and extensibility.

- **Authentication Framework:** EAP defines the architecture for authentication but does not specify a single method, enabling support for multiple approaches.
- **Custom EAP Methods:** Vendors and manufacturers can develop their own EAP methods, allowing integration of proprietary authentication techniques.
- **Integration with Standards:** EAP operates in compliance with RFC standards, ensuring interoperability across devices and platforms.
- **802.1X Integration:** EAP works seamlessly with the IEEE 802.1X standard to control network access. It ensures that devices are authenticated before gaining access to the network.

By supporting diverse authentication methods and working alongside protocols like 802.1X, EAP is widely used in wireless and wired network environments to enhance security and flexibility.

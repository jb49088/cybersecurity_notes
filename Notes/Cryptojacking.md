# Cryptojacking

Cryptojacking is the unauthorized use of a victim's computer or device to mine cryptocurrencies. It involves installing or running cryptocurrency mining scripts or malware on a device without the user's consent or knowledge. The goal of cryptojacking is to harness the computational resources of multiple devices to mine cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Monero, or Ethereum, for financial gain.


## Types 

- **Browser-Based Cryptojacking:** In-browser scripts (e.g., Coinhive) embedded in websites use visitors' CPU resources to mine cryptocurrencies while they browse the site, without their consent.

- **File-Based Cryptojacking:** Malware installed on a device runs in the background and uses its computational resources to mine cryptocurrencies.

- **Cloud Cryptojacking:** Attackers compromise cloud infrastructure (e.g., misconfigured Kubernetes clusters) to deploy mining malware and exploit cloud resources for cryptocurrency mining.

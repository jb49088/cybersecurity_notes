# Peripheral devices

Peripheral devices add much-needed functionality to computers, beyond the core components. Having a fast processor and terabytes of hard drive space is great, but it doesn’t complete the picture. Users need the ability to input data and easily see and use the output that the processor generates. Of course, the types of devices that can input or receive output are quite varied. 

## Video Devices

The primary method of getting information out of a computer is to use a computer video
display. Display systems convert computer signals into text and pictures and display them
on a TV-like screen. As a matter of fact, early personal computers used television screens
because it was simpler to use an existing display technology than to develop a new one. The
most common video device used is a monitor.

### Monitors

Most display systems work the same way. First, the computer sends a signal to a device called the video adapter—an expansion board installed in an expansion bus slot or the equivalent circuitry integrated into the motherboard—telling it to display a particular graphic or character. The adapter then renders the character for the display—that is, it converts the single instruction into several instructions that tell the display device how to draw the graphic and sends the instructions to the display device based on the connection technology between the two. The primary differences after that are in the type of video adapter you are using (digital or analog) and the type of display (LCD, LED, IPS, and so forth). 

> [!info] Note
> Many monitors sold today are touch screens. Touch screen technology converts stimuli of some sort, which are generated by actually touching the screen, to electrical impulses that travel over serial connections to the computer system. These input signals allow for the replacement of the mouse, both in terms of movement and in clicking. With onscreen key- boards, the external keyboard can be retired as well. This technology is used extensively with smartphones, tablets, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as automobile information systems, security systems, and smart thermostats. Many laptops today have touch screens as well. The technology has invaded the PC market, too, but has yet to totally dominate it. It’s probably just a matter of time, though.

#### Types of monitors

PC monitors today are generally based on some form of liquid crystal display (LCD) technology. First used with portable computers and then adapted to desktop monitors, LCDs are based on the concept that when an electrical current is passed through a semi- crystalline liquid, the crystals align themselves with the current. When transistors are combined with these liquid crystals, patterns can be formed. Patterns can then be combined to represent numbers or letters. LCDs are relatively lightweight and don’t consume much power. 

Liquid crystals produce no light, so LCD monitors need a lighting source to display an image. Traditional LCDs use a fluorescent bulb called a backlight to produce light. Most LCDs today use a panel of light- emitting diodes (LEDs) instead, which consume less energy, run cooler, and live longer than fluorescent bulbs. Therefore, when you see a monitor advertised as an LED monitor, it’s really an LCD monitor with LED backlighting. 

Another type of LED monitor is an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display. Unlike LED displays, OLEDs are the image-producing parts of the display and the light source. Because of this there is no need for a backlight with its additional power and space requirements, unlike in the case of LCD panels. Additionally, the contrast ratio of OLED displays exceeds that of LCD panels, regardless of backlight source. This means that in darker surroundings, OLED displays produce better images than do LCD panels. In addition, if thin-film electrodes and a flexible compound are used to produce the OLEDs, an OLED display can be made flexible, allowing it to function in novel applications where other display technologies could never work. OLED monitors are usually high-quality displays.

> [!info] Note 
> Nearly all monitors in use today are flat screen monitors based on LCD technology. Occasionally, though, you will run into a monitor that’s not flat and can be over a foot deep. These relics are based on old television technology called the cathode ray tube (CRT). CRT monitors are bulky and heavy, and almost certainly use an analog signal (and VGA connector) instead of digital.

Other acronyms you will see when looking at LCD monitors include twisted nematic (TN), vertical alignment (VA), and in-plane switching (IPS). The short explanation of the differences is that each technology aligns the liquid crystals in a different manner, resulting in performance differences. Generally speaking, TN monitors are the fastest but have the worst color performance and contrast ratios (the difference between black and lit pixels), whereas VA are the slowest but have the most vivid color contrasts. IPS is somewhere in between the two. The speed aspect often makes TN the choice for gamers.

#### Adjusting Display Settings

Although most monitors are automatically detected by the operating system and configured for the best quality that they and the graphics adapter support, sometimes manually changing display settings, such as for a new monitor or when adding a new adapter, becomes necessary. Let’s start by defining a few important terms:

- Refresh rate 
- Resolution
- Multiple displays

Each of these terms relates to settings available through the operating system by way of
display-option settings.

> [!info] Refresh rate 
> The refresh rate—technically, the vertical scan frequency—specifies how many times in one second the image on the screen can be completely redrawn, if necessary. Measured in screen draws per second, or hertz (Hz), the refresh rate indicates how much effort is being put into checking for updates to the displayed image.
>
> >
>
> For LCD screens, the refresh rate may or may not be adjustable. The lowest standard refresh rate is 60 Hz, but higher-end monitors will be in the 240 Hz to 360 Hz range. 
>
> >
>
> Higher refresh rates translate to more fluid video motion. Think of the refresh rate as how often a check is made to see if each pixel has been altered by the source. If a pixel should change before the next refresh, the monitor is unable to display the change in that pixel. Therefore, for gaming and home- theater systems, higher refresh rates are an advantage.
>
> >
>
> While the refresh rate is selected for the monitor, the refresh rate you select must be supported by both your graphics adapter and your monitor because the adapter drives the monitor. If a monitor supports only one refresh rate, it does not matter how many different rates your adapter supports—without overriding the defaults, you will be able to choose only the one common refresh rate. It is important to note that as the resolution you select increases, the higher supported refresh rates begin to disappear from the selection menu. If you want a higher refresh rate, you might have to compromise by choosing a lower resolution.

> [!info] Resolution
> Resolution is defined by how many software picture elements (pixels) are used to draw the screen. An advantage of higher resolutions is that more information can be displayed in the same screen area. A disadvantage is that the same objects and text displayed at a higher resolution appear smaller and might be harder to see. Up to a point, the added crispness of higher resolutions displayed on high-quality monitors compensates for the negative aspects.
>
> >
>
> The resolution is described in terms of the visible image’s dimensions, which indicate how many rows and columns of pixels are used to draw the screen. For example, a resolution of 2560 × 1440 means 2560 pixels across (columns) and 1440 pixels down (rows) were used to draw the pixel matrix. The video technology in this example would use 2560 × 1440 = 3,686,400 pixels to draw the screen. Resolution is a software setting that is common among CRTs, LCDs, and projection systems, as well as other display devices. 
>
> >
>
> Setting the resolution for your monitor is fairly straightforward. If you are using an LCD, for best results you should use the monitor’s native resolution, which comes from the placement of the transistors in the hardware display matrix of the monitor. For a native resolution of 1680 × 1050, for example, there are 1,764,000 transistors (LCDs) or cells (OLED) arranged in a grid of 1680 columns and 1050 rows. Trying to display a resolution other than 1680 × 1050 through the operating system tends to result in the monitor interpolating the resolution to fit the differing number of software pixels to the 1,764,000 transistors, often resulting in a distortion of the image on the screen.
>
> >
>
> Some systems will scale the image to avoid distortion, but others will try to fill the screen with the image, resulting in distortion. On occasion, you might find that increasing the resolution beyond the native resolution results in the need to scroll the desktop in order to view other portions of it. In such instances, you cannot see the entire desktop all at the same time. The monitor has the last word in how the signal it receives from the adapter is displayed. Adjusting your display settings to those that are recommended for your monitor can alleviate this scrolling effect. 
>
> >
>
> To change the resolution in Windows 10, right- click the desktop and choose Display Settings (as in Exercise 3.1). There is a pull-down menu for resolution. Click it and choose the resolution you want, as shown in Figure 1.84. 
> - **Figure 1.84** Adjusting the resolution in Windows 10
![[Image 1.84.png]]
>
> > [!info] Understanding Aspect Ratios
> > The term aspect ratio refers to the relationship between the horizontal and vertical pixel counts that a monitor can display. For example, old square-ish CRTs were shaped to support a display that conformed to 4:3 ratios, such as 800 × 600 or 1024 × 768. If you divide the first number by 4 and multiply the result by 3, the product is equal to the second number. Additionally, if you divide the first number by the second number, the result is approximately 1.3, the same as 4 ÷ 3. Displays with a 16:10 aspect ratio have measurements that result in a dividend of 16 ÷ 10 = 1.6.
> >
> > >
> >
> > When LCD monitors first became popular, they had wider screens and most supported a 16:10 ratio. Because the ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee) standard for wide- screen television aspect ratios is 16:9 (1.778), computer monitors are trending more toward this same aspect ratio. As a result, the once popular 1920 × 1200, 16:10 resolution is now less common than the 1920 × 1080, 16:9 resolution. If you have a monitor that supports one and you try to set it to the other, the image may look squished or stretched, or the monitor may not display at all.

> [!info] Multiple Displays
> Whether regularly or just on occasion, you may find yourself in a position where you need to use two monitors on the same computer simultaneously. For example, you may need to work in multiple spreadsheets at the same time and having two monitors makes it much easier. Or, if you are giving a presentation and would like to have a presenter’s view on your laptop’s LCD but need to project a slide show onto a screen, you might need to connect an external projector to the laptop. Simply connecting an external display device does not guarantee that it will be recognized and work automatically. You might need to change the settings to recognize the external device or adjust options such as the resolution or the device’s virtual orientation with respect to the built-in display.

#### Selecting a Monitor

If you go to your favorite online retailer and search for monitors, the number of choices can be overwhelming. Here are a few tips to help narrow the field to a manageable number of options. 

- **Determine what the monitor will be used for:** If it’s a general-purpose monitor, it
doesn’t need to be the newest and fanciest technology. If it will be for a gamer, though,
the minimum performance specifications just went up.

- **Choose a size:** This depends on how far the user will be sitting from the screen. For a regular office or home office setup, somewhere between 24" and 27" is the most popular today, with some people preferring the slightly larger 32". Anything bigger than that could be too large or not fit on the desk. If it will be viewed from across the room, then go as large as makes sense.

- **Pick a resolution:** The resolutions available may be somewhat dependent on the size of monitor you choose. Remember that higher resolutions result in sharper images. Three common options today are: 

	- **1080p/Full High Definition (FHD) (1920 × 1080):** This is the basic resolution used today. It’s tenable for monitors up to 24", but for larger monitors a higher resolution is needed; otherwise, icons and images appear oversized.
	- **1440p/Quad High Definition (QHD) (2560 × 1440):** For 27" and larger displays, this is the base performance you want to look for. Sometimes you will hear this referred to as 2k resolution.
	- **2160p/Ultra High Definition (UHD) (3840 × 2160):** Commonly referred to as 4k, it’s the resolution of choice for serious gamers and others who want ultrasharp and crisp pictures. It’s also great for those wanting to watch 4k movies on a monitor.

- **Choose a refresh rate:** Basic, run-of-the-mill LCD screens will have a 60 Hz refresh
rate; slightly nicer models will boast a 75 Hz rate. You probably won’t notice too much
of a difference between them. Gamers or those using their computer monitor to watch
live- action sports or movies will want at least 144 Hz as a minimum. Hardcore gamers
and ultimate performance seekers will want to go to at least 240 Hz. That kind of
refresh rate is overkill for people staring at office applications and email all day.

- **Consider the price:** Last but not least is price. The higher the specs, the more it will
cost. Balance the user’s needs with their budget to determine the right monitor to select.

### Projection Systems

Another major category of display device is the video projection system, or projector. A portable projector can be thought of as a condensed video display with a lighting system that projects the image onto a screen or other flat surface for group viewing. Interactive white- boards have become popular over the past decade to allow presenters to project an image onto the board as they use virtual markers to draw electronically on the displayed image. Remote participants can see the slide on their system as well as the markups made by the presenter. The presenter can see the same markups because the board transmits them to the computer to which the projector is attached, causing them to be displayed by the projector in real time.

To accommodate using portable units at variable distances from the projection surface, a focusing mechanism is included on the lens. Other adjustments, such as keystone, trapezoid, and pincushion, are provided through a menu system on many models as well as a way to rotate the image 180 degrees for ceiling-mount applications.

The key characteristics of projectors are resolution and brightness. Resolutions are similar to those of computer monitors. Brightness is measured in lumens. A lumen (lm) is a unit of measure for the total amount of visible light that the projector gives off, based solely on what the human eye can perceive and not on invisible wavelengths. Sometimes the brightness is even more of a selling point than the maximum resolution that the system supports because of the chosen environment in which it operates. For example, it takes a lot more to display a visible image in a well-lit office than it does in a darkened theater.

If you are able to completely control the lighting in the room where the projection system is used, producing little to no ambient light, a projector producing as little as 1,300 lumens is adequate in a home theater environment, while you would need one producing around 2,500 lumens in the office. However, if you can only get rid of most of the ambient light, such as by closing blinds and dimming overhead lights, the system should be able to produce 1,500 to 3,500 lumens in the home theater and 3,000 to 4,500 lumens in the office. If you have no control over a very well-lit area, you’ll need 4,000 to 4,500 lumens in the home theater and 5,000 to 6,000 lumens in the business setting. 

By way of comparison, a 60W standard light bulb produces about 800 lumens. Output is not linear, however, because a 100W light bulb produces over double, at 1,700 lm. Nevertheless, you couldn’t get away with using a standard 100W incandescent bulb in a projector. The color production is not pure enough and constantly changes throughout its operation due to deposits of soot from the burning of its tungsten filament during the production of light. High-intensity discharge (HID) lamps, like the ones found in projection systems, do more with less by using a smaller electrical discharge to produce far more visible light. Expect to pay considerably more for projector bulbs than for standard bulbs of a comparable wattage.

> Although it doesn’t take long for the fan to stop running and the projector to cool down, this phase should never be skipped to save time. With projector bulbs being one of the priciest consumables in the world of technology, doing so may cost you more than a change in your travel arrangements.
> 
> >
> 
> A fellow instructor relayed the story of carrying his own portable projector with him on the road. At the end of a week’s class, he would power down the projector and get his laptop and other goodies packed away. Just before running out of the door, he would unplug the projector and pack it up. As with many instructors, this gentleman’s presentations increased in density and length as he became more and more comfortable with the material. 
> 
> > 
> 
> Over time, his presentation had been running later and later each Friday afternoon, edging him ever closer to his airline departure time. He admitted that he had gotten into the habit of yanking the power plug for his projector from the wall and quickly stuffing the unit into the carrying case before darting out the door. It’s no wonder then that a few months after he started this behavior, his projector failed catastrophically. Replacing the bulb was not the solution.
> 
> > 
> 
> One caveat with projectors is that you must never pull the electrical plug from the outlet until you hear the internal fan cut off. There is enough residual heat generated by the projector bulb that damage to the electronics or the bulb itself (discoloration or outright failure) can occur if the fan is not allowed to remove enough heat before it stops running. Without a connection to an electrical outlet, the fan stops immediately. The electronics have the appropriate level of heat shielding so that the fan removes enough heat during normal operation to avoid damage to the shielded components. 

### Webcams

Years ago, owing to the continued growth of the Internet, video camera–only devices known as webcams started their climb in popularity. Today, with the prevalence of working from home and services like Zoom and Google Meet, it seems that everyone has been introduced to webcams.

Webcams make great security devices as well. Users can keep an eye on loved ones or property from anywhere that Internet access is available. Care must be taken, however, because the security that the webcam is intended to provide can backfire on the user if the webcam is not set up properly. Anyone who happens upon the web interface for the device can control its actions if there is no authentication enabled. Some webcams provide a light that illuminates when someone activates the camera. Nevertheless, it is possible to decouple the camera’s operation and that of its light. 

Nearly every laptop produced today has a webcam built into its bezel. An example is shown in Figure 1.87—this one has a light and two microphones built in next to it. If a system doesn’t have a built-in camera, a webcam connects directly to the computer through an I/O interface, typically USB. Webcams that have built-in wired and wireless NIC interfaces for direct network attachment are prevalent as well. A webcam does not have any self-contained recording mechanism. Its sole purpose is to transfer its captured video directly to the host computer, usually for further transfer over the Internet—hence, the term web.

- **Figure 1.87** An integrated webcam
![[Image 1.87.png]]

## Audio Devices

Audio devices, true to their name, produce sound by plugging into a sound card. Many sound cards today are integrated into a device’s motherboard, but some computers still have separate audio expansion cards. Audio devices can provide output, such as through speakers or headphones, or input with a microphone.

Speakers and headphones generally connect with a 1/8" (3.5 mm) audio connector, as shown in Figure 1.88. Most audio connectors have two thin black bands engraved on them, which separates the connector into three parts: the tip, ring, and sleeve. Because of this, sometimes you will see these connectors referred to as TRS connectors. The tip provides left audio, the first band above the black groove (the ring) provides right audio, and the sleeve is the ground. You’ll notice that the connector in Figure 1.88 has three black bands, providing four connections and making it a TRRS connector. The fourth one is for the microphone.

- **Figure 1.88** 1/8" audio connector
![[Image 1.88.png]]

Headsets that provide audio and a microphone are popular for audio conferencing calls and video gaming. A sample headset is shown in Figure 1.89. This model connects via USB, as do most headsets. Volume controls and a microphone mute are located on the right earpiece.

- **Figure 1.89** A USB headset
![[Image 1.89.png]]

Although discussed throughout this chapter, the microphone has yet to be formally defined, a definition that is at once technical and simple. Microphones convert sound waves into varying electrical signals. The result can be recorded, transmitted, or altered in a variety of ways, including amplification. 

When installing a microphone, you must match its connector with an available one on the computer. Modern choices include the classic analog pink TRS connector and USB. Wireless versions also exist, but their receiver might still be connected to a standard I/O port. Alternatively, the microphone could be paired with a built-in Bluetooth transceiver, headphones, or headset. 

Configuring a microphone on a PC is most often performed through the Recording tab of the Sound applet in Control Panel. Options include setting the levels and choosing enhancements, such as noise suppression and echo cancellation. Specialized applications may also have internal configuration for the microphone, passing most details of the configuration back to the operating system.

## Input and Output Devices

An input device is one that transfers information from outside the computer system to an internal storage location, such as system RAM, video RAM, flash memory, or disk storage. Without input devices, computers would be unable to change from their default boot-up state. An output device does the opposite of an input device—it takes information that’s stored in RAM or another location and spits it back out somewhere for the user to do something with it. We’ve already covered monitors, which are the most common output device. The other major type of output device is a printer. Chapter 4, “Printers and Multi- function Devices,” is dedicated to them. Further, some devices are capable of managing both input and output.

> [!info] Note
> Frequently, when discussed together, input and output are abbreviated as I/O.

### Keyboard

The keyboard is easily the most popular input device, so much so that it’s more of a necessity. Very few users would even think of beginning a computing session without a working keyboard. Fewer still would even know how. The U.S. English keyboard places keys in the same orientation as the QWERTY typewriter keyboards, which were developed in the 1860s. Wired keyboards are almost always attached via USB. Wireless keyboards will often have a USB dongle that is attached to the computer, but they can also use Bluetooth. 

Keyboards have also added separate number pads to the side and function keys (not to be confused with the common laptop key labeled Fn), placed in a row across the top of the keyboard above the numerical row. Key functionality can be modified by using one or more combinations of the Ctrl, Alt, Shift, and laptop Fn keys along with the normal QWERTY keys.

Technically speaking, the keys on a keyboard complete individual circuits when each one is pressed. The completion of each circuit leads to a unique scan code that is sent to the keyboard connector on the computer system. The computer uses a keyboard controller chip or function to interpret the code as the corresponding key sequence. The computer then decides what action to take based on the key sequence and what it means to the computer and the active application, including simply displaying the character printed on the key. 

In addition to the layout for a standard keyboard, other keyboard layouts exist—some not nearly as popular. For example, without changing the order of the keys, an ergonomic keyboard is designed to feel more comfortable to users as they type. The typical human’s hands do not rest with the fingers straight down. Ergonomic keyboards, therefore, should not place keys flat and along the same plane. To accomplish that goal, manufacturers split the keyboard down the middle, angling keys on each side downward from the center. Doing so fits the keys to the fingers of the hands when they are in a relaxed state. Figure 1.90 shows an example of an ergonomic keyboard. Even more exotic- looking ergonomic keyboards exist and may provide better relief for users who suffer from repetitive-use problems such as carpal tunnel. 

- **Figure 1.90** An ergonomic keyboard
![[Image 1.90.png]]

### Mouse

Although the computer mouse was born in the 1970s at Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), it was in 1984 that Apple made the mouse an integral part of the personal computer with the introduction of the Macintosh. In its most basic form, the mouse is a hand-fitting device that uses some form of motion- detection mechanism to translate its own physical two-dimensional movement into onscreen cursor motion. Many variations of the mouse exist, including trackballs, tablets, touch pads, and pointing sticks. Figure 1.91 illustrates the most recognizable form of the mouse.

- **Figure 1.91** A computer mouse
![[Image 1.91.png]]

The motion-detection mechanism of the original Apple mouse was a simple ball that protruded from the bottom of the device so that when the bottom was placed against a flat surface that offered a slight amount of friction, the mouse would glide over the surface but the ball would roll, actuating two rollers that mapped the linear movement to a Cartesian plane and transmitted the results to the software interface. This method of motion detection has been replaced by optical receptors to catch LED light reflected from the surface the mouse is used on. Note that most optical mice will have problems working on a transparent glass surface because of the lack of reflectivity.

The mouse today can be wired to the computer system or connected wirelessly. A wired
mouse typically uses a USB port, which also provides power. Wireless versions will have a
USB dongle or connect via Bluetooth. They are powered with batteries, and the optical varieties deplete these batteries more quickly than their mechanical counterparts.

The final topic is one that is relevant for any mouse: buttons. The number of buttons that you need your mouse to have depends on the software interfaces you use. For the Macintosh, one button has always been sufficient, but for a Windows-based computer, at least two are recommended—hence, the term right-click. Today, the mouse is commonly found to have a wheel on top to aid in scrolling and other specialty movement. The wheel has even developed a click in many models, sort of an additional button underneath the wheel. Buttons on the side of the mouse that can be programmed for whatever the user desires are common today as well.

There are several variants on pointer devices, such as trackballs. A trackball is like an inverted mouse. Both devices place the buttons on the top, which is where your fingers will be. A mouse places its tracking mechanism on the bottom, requiring that you move the entire assembly as an analogue for how you want the cursor on the screen to move. In contrast, a trackball places the tracking mechanism, usually a ball that is about one inch in diameter, on the top with the buttons. You then have a device that need not be moved around on the desktop and can work in tight spaces and on surfaces that would be incompatible with the use of a mouse. The better trackballs place the ball and buttons in such a configuration that your hand rests ergonomically on the device, allowing effortless control of the onscreen cursor.

> [!info] Note
> Other input devices you may encounter are touch pads (especially on laptops), signature pads, game controllers, barcode and QR code scanners, magnetic or chip readers, and nearfield communication (NFC) devices such as tap-to-pay devices. They almost always connect to the computer using a USB port

> 
> A KVM switch isn’t an input or output device per se, but it allows you to switch between sets of input and output devices. The KVM switch is named after the devices among which it allows you to switch. The initials stand for keyboard, video, and mouse. KVM switches come in a variety of models, with different connector types available.
> 
> >
> 
> The purpose of the switch is to allow you to have multiple computers attached to the same keyboard, monitor, and mouse. You can use these three devices with only one system at a time. Some switches have a dial that you turn to select which system attaches to the com- ponents, while others feature buttons for each system connected. Common uses of KVM switches include using the same components alternately for a desktop computer and a laptop docking station or having a server room with multiple servers but no need to inter- face with them simultaneously. 

## Storage Devices 

Storage devices such as hard drives and optical drives are frequently internal to the case, but external options are available as well.

Take optical drives, for instance. In order to save space on laptops, manufacturers usually don’t include internal optical drives. If users want to play a Blu-ray or DVD movie, they will need to attach an external optical drive. External optical drives can be used for data backups as well. These external drives will most likely connect via USB or eSATA.

External storage drives can greatly enhance the storage capacity of a computer, or they can provide networked storage for several users. A plethora of options is available, from single drives to multi-drive systems with several terabytes of capacity. Figure 1.92 shows an external network-attached storage (NAS) device.

Looking at Figure 1.92, you can see that this is a self-enclosed unit that can hold up to four hard drives. Some hold more; some hold fewer. Nicer NAS systems enable you to hot-swap hard drives and have built-in fault tolerance as well.

In addition to the hardware, the NAS device contains its own operating system, meaning that it acts like its own file server. In most cases, you can plug it in, do some very minor con- figuration, and have instant storage space on your network. As far as connectivity goes, NAS systems will connect to a PC through a USB or eSATA port, but that is primarily so you can use that PC to run the configuration software for the NAS. The NAS also connects to the network, and that is how all network users access the storage space.

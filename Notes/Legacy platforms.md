# Legacy platforms

Legacy platforms refer to outdated systems, applications, or technologies that are still in use but are no longer supported or updated. These platforms may be essential for an organizationâ€™s operations, but they often pose significant security, performance, and compatibility risks.

## Key issues with legacy platforms:

- **Security Risks:** Lack of security updates makes legacy platforms vulnerable to cyberattacks.
- **Compliance Challenges:** Legacy systems may not meet modern regulatory requirements.
- **Integration Issues:** Difficulty in integrating legacy platforms with newer technologies or systems.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Ongoing support and repair costs can be high as expertise and parts become scarce.

Despite their challenges, many organizations continue using legacy platforms due to high migration costs, business continuity, or dependency on specific features. However, organizations should consider planning for modernization or replacement to reduce risks and improve efficiency.

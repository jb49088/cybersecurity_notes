# Rule-based access control (RBAC)

[[üè∑Ô∏èAccess control model]]

Rule-based access control (RBAC) manages access based on predefined system-enforced rules. These rules consider conditions beyond the identity of the user, providing a dynamic and adaptable access control model.

- **Follows system-defined rules:** Access is determined by conditions set by administrators, not end-users.
- **Links rules to resources:** Each object has rules associated with it, and the system evaluates access control lists (ACLs) for compliance.
- **Implements time-based access:** Example: A lab network may only be available between 9 AM and 5 PM.
- **Enforces application-specific rules:** Example: Only Chrome browsers can access certain web forms.
- **Strengthens security:** Ensures consistent enforcement of access rules across the system.

Rule-based access control provides flexibility in managing permissions and supports complex scenarios requiring contextual access policies.

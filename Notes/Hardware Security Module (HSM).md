[[üè∑Ô∏èSecurity hardware]]

A Hardware Security Module (HSM) is a physical device designed to securely generate, store, and manage cryptographic keys and perform cryptographic operations. HSMs are used to protect sensitive data and cryptographic processes, such as encryption, decryption, authentication, and digital signatures, in a highly secure and tamper-resistant environment.

HSMs are commonly deployed in industries that require stringent security, including banking, government, and healthcare. They provide a hardware-based solution to prevent unauthorized access and ensure compliance with security standards.

Key features of an HSM include:

- **Key Management**: Secure generation, storage, and lifecycle management of cryptographic keys.
- **Tamper Resistance**: Built-in mechanisms to detect and respond to physical or logical tampering.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for cryptographic operations, enabling fast processing of secure transactions.
- **Standards Compliance**: Adherence to security standards such as FIPS 140-2 or Common Criteria.

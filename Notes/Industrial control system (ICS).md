# Industrial control system (ICS)

Industrial control systems (ICS) are integrated hardware and software solutions designed to monitor, control, and automate industrial processes. They are widely used in industries like manufacturing, energy, water management, transportation, and critical infrastructure.

- **Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA):** Focuses on remote monitoring and control, often over large geographic areas.
- **Distributed Control Systems (DCS):** Manages processes within a single facility, offering fine-grained control and automation.
- **Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs):** Serve as modular, programmable controllers for specific tasks, often within SCADA or DCS frameworks.
- **Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI):** Provide operators with graphical dashboards for real-time monitoring and control.

ICS ensures operational efficiency, safety, and reliability by automating complex industrial processes. However, the integration of ICS with IT systems has increased exposure to cybersecurity risks, necessitating robust protection measures against threats.

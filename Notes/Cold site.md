# Cold site

A cold site is a disaster recovery solution that provides a basic facility without any pre-installed hardware, software, or data. It serves as a backup location where an organization can set up operations in the event of a disaster, but it requires significant time and resources to become operational.

A cold site typically consists of an empty building or space equipped with essential utilities like power, internet connectivity, and climate control. However, it lacks any hardware or equipment; organizations must bring their own servers, storage, and networking devices. Similarly, no data is stored at the site, so organizations must transport or restore data from backups.

Additionally, a cold site does not include personnel on-site, meaning the organization must send in its team to set up and manage operations. While a cold site is the most cost-effective option among disaster recovery solutions, it also requires the longest time to become functional, making it suitable for scenarios where immediate recovery is not critical.

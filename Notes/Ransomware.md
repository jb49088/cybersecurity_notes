[[🏷️Malware]] 

Ransomware is a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system or files, often by encrypting them, until a ransom is paid. Attackers typically demand payment in cryptocurrency for the decryption key, threatening to destroy the files or release sensitive information if the victim refuses to comply. Ransomware attacks can cause significant financial and data loss, and they often target businesses, government institutions, and individuals.

[[üè∑Ô∏èAsymmetric encryption algorithm]]

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is an asymmetric encryption algorithm based on the mathematics of elliptic curves over finite fields. ECC provides high levels of security with shorter key lengths compared to traditional algorithms like RSA, making it more efficient in terms of computational power and bandwidth usage.

ECC operates on the principle that it is difficult to solve the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP), which forms the basis of its security. It allows the generation of a public-private key pair, where the public key can be shared, and the private key remains confidential. ECC is widely used in secure communications, digital signatures, and key exchange protocols, including SSL/TLS and cryptocurrencies.

Due to its efficiency and strong security with smaller key sizes, ECC is becoming increasingly popular, especially in mobile devices and environments where computational resources are limited.

# Chain of custody

Chain of custody refers to the process of tracking and documenting the handling of evidence from the moment it is collected until it is presented in court. Maintaining an unbroken and documented chain ensures the integrity of the evidence.

- **Control evidence to maintain integrity:** It is crucial to ensure evidence is handled carefully and is protected from tampering or unauthorized access.
- **Track everyone who contacts the evidence:** Use hashes and digital signatures to verify the authenticity of evidence and prevent tampering.
- **Label and catalog everything:** Digitally tag each item for precise tracking, ensuring proper documentation of the evidence's movement and storage.
- **Seal and store securely:** Once labeled, evidence must be sealed and stored in a secure location to maintain its integrity and prevent contamination.

A well-maintained chain of custody ensures that evidence can be trusted in legal proceedings and helps prevent any challenges regarding its authenticity.

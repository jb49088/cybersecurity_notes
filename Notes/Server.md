Servers come in many shapes and sizes. They are a core component of the network, providing a link to the resources necessary to perform any task. The link that the server provides could be to a resource existing on the server itself or to a resource on a client computer. The server is the critical enabler, offering directions to the client computers regarding where to go to get what they need.

Servers offer networks the capability of centralizing the control of resources and security,
thereby reducing administrative difficulties. They can be used to distribute processes for
balancing the load on computers and can thus increase speed and performance. They can
also compartmentalize files for improved reliability. That way, if one server goes down, not
all of the files are lost.

Servers can perform several different critical roles on a network. For example, a server that provides files to the users on the network is called a file server. Likewise, one that hosts printing services for users is called a print server. Servers can be used for other tasks as well, such as authentication, remote access services, administration, email, and so on.

Networks can include multipurpose and single-purpose servers. A multipurpose server can be, for example, both a file server and a print server at the same time. If the server is a single-purpose server, it is a file server only or a print server only. Another distinction we use in categorizing servers is whether they are dedicated or nondedicated: 

- **Dedicated Servers:** A dedicated server is assigned to provide specific applications or services for the network and nothing else. Because a dedicated server specializes in only a few tasks, it requires fewer resources than a nondedicated server might require from the computer that is hosting it. This savings may translate to efficiency and can thus be considered as having a beneficial impact on network performance. A web server is an example of a dedicated server; it is dedicated to the task of serving up web pages and nothing else.

- **Nondedicated Servers:** Nondedicated servers are assigned to provide one or more network services and local access. A nondedicated server is expected to be slightly more flexible in its day-to-day use than a dedicated server. Nondedicated servers can be used to direct network traffic and perform administrative actions, but they also are often used to serve as a frontend for the administrator to work with other applications or services or to perform services for more than one network. For example, a dedicated web server might serve out one or more websites, whereas a nondedicated web server serves out websites but might also function as a print server on the local network or as the administrator‚Äôs workstation.

The nondedicated server is not what some would consider a true server, because it can act as a workstation as well as a server. The workgroup server at your office is an example of a nondedicated server. It might be a combination file, print, and email server. Plus, because of its nature, a nondedicated server could also function well in a peer- to- peer environment. It could be used as a workstation in addition to being a file, print, and email server.

Many networks use both dedicated and nondedicated servers to incorporate the best of both worlds, offering improved network performance with the dedicated servers and flexibility with the nondedicated servers.

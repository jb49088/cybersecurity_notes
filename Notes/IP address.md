# IP Address

An internet protocol address, or IP address, is a unique string of characters that identifies a location of a device on the internet. Each device on the internet has a unique IP address, just like every house on a street has its own mailing address.

There are two types of IP addresses: 

- **IP Version 4 (IPv4):** IPv4 addresses are represented as four sets of 1 to 3-digit numbers separated by periods, such as 19.117.63.126. Initially, all internet addresses were IPv4. However, as internet usage expanded, the supply of IPv4 addresses began to dwindle, leading to the development of IPv6.

- **IP Version 6 (IPv6):** IPv6 addresses consist of 32 hexadecimal characters, such as 684D:1111:222:3333:4444:5555:6:77. This extended format provides a vastly larger address space, accommodating a significantly greater number of devices and ensuring that we won't run out of addresses as quickly as we did with IPv4.

IP addresses can be either public or private. Your ISP assigns a public IP address that is connected to your geographic location. When network communications goes out from your device on the internet, they all have the same public-facing address. Just like all the roommates in one home share the same mailing address, all the devices on a network share the same public-facing IP address.

Private IP addresses are only seen by other devices on the same local network. This means that all the devices on your home network can communicate with each other using unique IP addresses that the rest of the internet can't see.

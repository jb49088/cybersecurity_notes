# Peer to peer (P2P)

Peer-to-peer (P2P) is a decentralized network model where devices, or "peers," communicate directly with each other without relying on a central server. P2P networks distribute tasks, storage, and bandwidth across multiple participants, making them scalable and resilient.

- **Decentralized communication:** Unlike client-server models, P2P allows devices to connect and share resources directly.
- **File sharing:** P2P is widely used in **file-sharing applications** like BitTorrent, where data is distributed across multiple peers for faster and more efficient downloads.
- **Blockchain and cryptocurrencies:** Many blockchain networks, including Bitcoin, rely on P2P architecture to maintain a decentralized ledger.
- **VoIP and messaging:** P2P is used in communication platforms like **Skype** (earlier versions) and **some secure messaging apps** to enable direct user-to-user connections.
- **Security concerns:** While P2P offers advantages like **fault tolerance** and **efficiency,** it can also pose risks such as **malware distribution, data leakage,** and difficulty in enforcing content regulations.

P2P technology continues to play a critical role in decentralized computing, enabling secure, distributed applications without reliance on central authorities.

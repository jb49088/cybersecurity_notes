# Global positioning system (GPS)

The Global positioning system (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation system that allows for precise location tracking and time synchronization anywhere on Earth. Originally developed by the U.S. Department of Defense, GPS is now widely used in consumer devices, vehicles, smartphones, and various industrial applications for navigation, mapping, and geolocation services.

GPS works by using a network of at least 24 satellites orbiting the Earth. These satellites continuously transmit signals that contain the satellite's location and the exact time the signal was sent. GPS receivers on the ground capture these signals from multiple satellites and use the time delay between the transmission and reception to calculate the receiver's exact position (latitude, longitude, and altitude). By triangulating data from at least three satellites, the receiver can pinpoint its location with high accuracy.

In addition to location tracking, GPS is also used for time synchronization in various applications such as telecommunications, financial transactions, and power grids. The system provides critical data for operations that require precise timing, contributing to the smooth functioning of global infrastructure.

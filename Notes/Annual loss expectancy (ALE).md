# Annual loss expectancy (ALE)

Annual loss expectancy (ALE) is a risk management metric used to estimate the potential financial loss an organization may face due to specific risks or threats over the course of a year. ALE helps organizations assess the cost of security incidents, enabling them to prioritize resources and implement effective mitigation strategies.

ALE is calculated by multiplying the **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)**, which is the cost of a single occurrence of a specific risk, by the **Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO)**, which is the estimated number of times the risk will occur within a year. The formula is:

**ALE = SLE Ã— ARO**

This metric is useful for quantifying risks and determining whether the cost of implementing a security control is justified. By understanding the ALE, organizations can make informed decisions on how to allocate resources to reduce the potential impact of security incidents.

ALE is an important tool for decision-making in the context of business continuity planning and disaster recovery, as it provides a clear picture of the financial impact of various risks.

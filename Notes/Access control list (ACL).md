# Access control list (ACL)

An access control list (ACL) is a security mechanism used to regulate access to resources by specifying which users, systems, or processes are allowed or denied specific actions. ACLs play a key role in enforcing security policies across networks, systems, and applications, ensuring that only authorized entities can access sensitive data or perform specific operations.

An ACL typically consists of a series of rules or entries that define permissions for various users or groups. These permissions dictate actions such as reading, writing, or executing files, accessing network devices, or sending data through network interfaces. For example, an ACL on a network router may allow traffic from authorized IP addresses while blocking traffic from untrusted or malicious sources.

ACLs are commonly implemented in:

- **File Systems:** Controlling user access to files and directories.
- **Network Security:** Filtering traffic based on IP addresses, protocols, or ports on firewalls, routers, or switches.
- **Applications:** Managing user privileges within software systems or databases.

By defining granular access rules, ACLs help prevent unauthorized actions and enhance overall system security. Regular review and updates of ACLs are essential to ensure they align with evolving security requirements.

# Subnet

[[🏷️Networking]]

A portion of a larger Network that has been divided to create smaller, more manageable networks. Subnetting is a technique used to improve performance, security, and organization of network resources. For example, at a university, there may be a faculty subnet and a separate students subnet. If there is contamination on the student's subnet, network administrators can isolate it and keep the rest of the network free from contamination.

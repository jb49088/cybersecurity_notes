Dark web intelligence involves gathering and analyzing information from hidden online networks where illicit activities often take place. These networks, accessible only through specialized software and configurations, are used by cybercriminals to trade, communicate, and collaborate.

Key areas of focus in dark web intelligence include:

- **Hacking groups and services:** Monitoring activities, tools, techniques, and services like credit card sales, stolen accounts, and passwords.
- **Forum activity:** Keeping track of discussions mentioning company names, executive names, or other targeted information to identify potential threats.

Dark web intelligence helps organizations stay proactive by identifying risks, uncovering criminal plans, and safeguarding sensitive data before it can be exploited.

[[üè∑Ô∏èOS component]]

The Linux kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system. It acts as an intermediary between the hardware and the software, managing system resources and enabling communication between different components. The kernel is responsible for essential tasks such as memory management, process scheduling, hardware abstraction, and device management. It is open-source and can be modified, making it highly customizable for various use cases.

- **Process management:** The kernel is responsible for managing processes, allocating CPU time, and handling multitasking. It ensures that processes run smoothly and efficiently without interfering with each other.
- **Memory management:** It oversees the allocation and deallocation of memory resources, ensuring that processes have enough memory to function and that memory is used efficiently.
- **Device drivers:** The kernel includes device drivers that allow communication between the operating system and hardware components, such as storage devices, network adapters, and input devices.
- **File system management:** It provides the interface for managing data storage, handling file systems, and facilitating access to files and directories.
- **Security and access control:** The kernel enforces security policies, ensuring that processes are isolated from each other and preventing unauthorized access to system resources.

The Linux kernel is modular, meaning that additional functionality can be added through loadable kernel modules, allowing for greater flexibility and adaptability.

# Wide Area Network (WAN)

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork type]]

By the late 1980s, networks were expanding to cover large geographical areas and were supporting thousands of users. The concept of a wide area network (WAN) was born. WANs were first implemented with mainframes at massive government expense, but started attracting PC users as networks went to this new level. Employees of businesses with offices across the country communicated as though they were only desks apart. Soon the whole world saw a change in the way of doing business, across not only a few miles but across countries. Whereas LANs are limited to single buildings, WANs can span buildings, states, countries, and even continental boundaries. Figure 2.20 shows an example of a simple WAN.

Generally speaking, it‚Äôs safe to think of a WAN as multiple dispersed LANs connected together. Historically, only larger corporations used WANs, but many smaller companies with remote locations now use them as well. The networks of today and tomorrow are no longer limited by the inability of LANs to cover distance and handle mobility. WANs play an important role in the future development of corporate networks worldwide. Image 2.20 depicts a simple WAN.

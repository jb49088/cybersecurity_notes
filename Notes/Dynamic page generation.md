# Dynamic page generation

[[üè∑Ô∏èWeb application security]]

Dynamic page generation is a cybersecurity defense strategy used to make web applications more resistant to attacks. It involves creating web content or resources in real-time based on user inputs or session data. This makes it harder for attackers to predict page structures or access sensitive information, as each request can produce unique content.

By dynamically generating pages, organizations can reduce vulnerabilities to attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), while also improving the ability to track malicious activities. This technique is often used alongside other defenses like Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and encryption.

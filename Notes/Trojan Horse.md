# Trojan Horse

[[üè∑Ô∏èMalware]] 

A Trojan horse is a type of malicious software that disguises itself as a legitimate program or file in order to trick users into installing it. Once activated, a Trojan can carry out a variety of harmful actions on the infected system, such as stealing sensitive information, damaging files, or providing unauthorized access to the attacker. Unlike viruses or worms, Trojans do not self-replicate but rely on social engineering to convince users to download and execute them.

Trojans can be delivered through email attachments, malicious websites, or even bundled with seemingly legitimate software. Once installed, they may open backdoors for cybercriminals to gain control of the system, potentially leading to data theft, system corruption, or further exploitation of the compromised device.

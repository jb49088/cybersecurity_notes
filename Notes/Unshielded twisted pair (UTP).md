# Unshielded twisted pair (UTP)

Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) is a type of copper cabling used in telecommunications and computer networks. It consists of pairs of insulated wires twisted together, which helps reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI). UTP cables are widely used for Ethernet networking, phone lines, and other data transmission applications due to their cost-effectiveness and ease of installation.

- **Cost-effective:** UTP cables are relatively inexpensive compared to other cabling options, such as shielded twisted pair (STP) or fiber optic cables.
- **Common use in networking:** Predominantly used for Ethernet networks (e.g., Cat5e, Cat6 cables) to connect computers, switches, and routers.
- **Reduced interference:** The twisted pair design helps reduce crosstalk and external electromagnetic interference, though it is not as effective as shielded cables.
- **Limited transmission distance:** UTP is suitable for shorter distance runs (up to 100 meters for Ethernet), beyond which signal quality may degrade.
- **Flexible and easy to install:** Lightweight and easy to handle, making it ideal for a variety of installations in homes and offices.

UTP remains a popular choice for both residential and commercial networking due to its affordability, versatility, and reliable performance in many networking scenarios.

# Shell scripting

Shell scripting is the practice of writing scripts for a command-line interpreter, or shell, to automate tasks on Unix-like operating systems. These scripts are text files containing a sequence of commands that the shell executes in order, allowing users to perform complex or repetitive tasks efficiently.

- **Automation of tasks:** Shell scripts automate routine operations like file manipulation, program execution, and system monitoring, reducing manual effort and errors.
- **Shell environments:** Common shells include Bash (Bourne Again SHell), Zsh, and Dash, each with its own scripting syntax and features.
- **Variables and control structures:** Shell scripts support variables, conditionals (if, case), loops (for, while), and functions, enabling the creation of dynamic and flexible scripts.
- **Interacting with the system:** Scripts can execute system commands, manage files and processes, and interact with users via input/output.
- **Portability:** Well-written shell scripts can run across different Unix-like systems, making them useful for administration and deployment tasks.

Shell scripting is essential for system administrators, developers, and power users looking to streamline workflows and manage systems effectively.

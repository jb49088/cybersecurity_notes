Workstations are the computers on which the network users do their work, performing activities such as word processing, database design, graphic design, email, and other office or personal tasks. A workstation is basically an everyday computer, except for the fact that it is connected to a network that offers additional resources. Workstations can range from diskless computer systems to desktops or laptops. In network terms, workstations are also known as client computers. As clients, they are allowed to communicate with the servers in the network to use the network’s resources.

It takes several items to make a workstation into a network client. You must install a network interface card (NIC), a special expansion card that allows the PC to talk on a network. You must connect it to a cabling system that connects to other computers (unless your NIC supports wireless networking). And you must install special software, called client software, which allows the computer to talk to the servers and request resources from them. Once all this has been accomplished, the computer is “on the network.”

> Network client software comes with all operating systems today. When you configure your computer to participate in the network, the operating system utilizes this software.

To the client, the server may be nothing more than just another drive letter. However, because it is in a network environment, the client can use the server as a doorway to more storage or more applications or to communicate with other computers or other networks. To users, being on a network changes a few things: 

- They can store more information because they can store data on other computers on the network. 
- They can share and receive information from other users, perhaps even collaborating on the same document.
- They can use programs that would be too large or complex for their computer to use by itself.
- They can use hardware not attached directly to their computer, such as a printer.

> This is one of the things that author Quentin Docter does when teaching novice technicians. In the room, there will be a standard- looking mini-tower desktop computer. He points to it and asks, “Is that a server or a workstation?” A lot of techs will look at it and say it’s a work- station because it is a desktop computer. The real answer is, “It depends.”

> Although many people have a perception that servers are ultra-fancy, rack-mounted devices, that isn’t necessarily true. It’s true that servers typically need more powerful hardware than do workstations because of their role on the network, but that doesn’t have to be the case. (Granted, having servers that are less powerful than your workstations doesn’t make logical sense.) What really differentiates a workstation from a server is what operating system it has installed and what role it plays on the network.

Computers with operating systems such as Windows 10 can be both clients on the network and nondedicated servers, as would be the case if you share your local printer with others on the network.

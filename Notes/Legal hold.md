# Legal hold

A legal hold is a process used to preserve relevant information for legal purposes, typically in anticipation of litigation. It ensures that potentially important data is not altered or destroyed during an investigation or legal proceedings.

- **Preserve relevant information:** Legal hold is used to ensure that data is retained in preparation for impending litigation, initiated by legal counsel to prevent the loss of evidence.
- **Hold notification:** Custodians, or those responsible for managing data, are notified and instructed to preserve all relevant data until further notice.
- **Separate repository for electronically stored information (ESI):** Information must be stored in a secure and dedicated location to ensure proper handling, considering various data sources, types, and retention requirements.
- **Ongoing preservation:** Once a legal hold is in place, there is an ongoing obligation to preserve data throughout the legal process, ensuring nothing is inadvertently deleted or altered.

Legal holds are crucial for protecting critical evidence and ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

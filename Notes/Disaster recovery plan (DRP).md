# Disaster recovery plan (DRP)

A disaster recovery plan (DRP) is a structured approach for responding to and recovering from disruptive events, such as cyberattacks, natural disasters, or hardware failures, to restore critical IT systems and business operations. The DRP is a key component of an organizationâ€™s broader business continuity plan (BCP) and focuses specifically on minimizing downtime and data loss.

- **Risk Assessment:** Identifying potential threats and their impact on IT infrastructure and operations.
- **Recovery Strategies:** Establishing procedures for restoring systems, applications, and data, such as backups, failover systems, and alternate site setups.
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** Setting the maximum acceptable downtime for critical systems.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** Defining the maximum tolerable data loss for each system or application.
- **Testing and Maintenance:** Regularly testing the plan to ensure its effectiveness and updating it to address evolving risks and changes in the IT environment.

A DRP reduces downtime, mitigates financial losses, and ensures a swift return to normal operations during emergencies.

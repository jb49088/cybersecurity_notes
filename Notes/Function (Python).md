# Function (Python)

[[üè∑Ô∏èPython]]

In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Defined with the def keyword, functions can accept inputs (parameters) and return output with the return statement. They help organize code, reduce repetition, and improve readability.

- **Built-in functions**: These are pre-defined functions in Python, like `print()`, `len()`, and `type()`, that are available for use without needing to define them.

- **User-defined functions**: These are functions created by the programmer using the `def` keyword to perform custom tasks, allowing for reusable and modular code.

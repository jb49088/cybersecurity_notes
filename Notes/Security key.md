# Security key

A security key is a physical device used for two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA). It provides an additional layer of security beyond a password, ensuring that only authorized users can access systems or services by requiring possession of the physical key.

- **Authentication method**: Security keys use cryptographic protocols such as Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) or FIDO2 to authenticate users, providing a secure, phishing-resistant way to prove identity.
- **Hardware-based security**: The key typically connects to a device via USB, NFC, or Bluetooth. Common examples include YubiKeys, which can be used across various platforms and services.
- **Phishing protection**: Since the security key requires physical possession, it effectively protects against phishing attacks, where a user might be tricked into entering their credentials on a fake website.
- **Compatibility**: Security keys are supported by a growing number of online services, including Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, offering an easy-to-use and highly secure authentication method.
- **Portability**: These devices are compact and easy to carry, making them convenient for users who need secure access to multiple accounts or systems.

Security keys are an effective way to protect sensitive accounts and systems, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access due to stolen passwords or other common attack methods.

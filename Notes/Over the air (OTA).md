# Over the air (OTA)

Over the air (OTA) refers to the wireless transmission of data, updates, or communications to devices without requiring a physical connection. OTA technology is widely used in mobile networks, software updates, and IoT devices to deliver new features, security patches, and configuration changes remotely.

- **Software and firmware updates:** OTA enables devices like smartphones, tablets, and IoT devices to receive system and security updates without requiring manual installation.
- **Mobile network provisioning:** Carriers use OTA to configure and update SIM cards, network settings, and device profiles over cellular networks.
- **Automotive updates:** Modern vehicles use OTA technology to receive updates for infotainment systems, navigation, and even vehicle performance improvements.
- **IoT and smart devices:** Many smart home and industrial IoT devices rely on OTA for firmware updates, ensuring they remain secure and functional.
- **Security considerations:** OTA transmissions must be encrypted and authenticated to prevent unauthorized modifications or attacks.

By eliminating the need for physical access, OTA technology provides a convenient, scalable, and efficient method for managing devices and ensuring they stay up to date.

# Personal Area Network (PAN)

[[🏷️Network type]]

In moving from LANs to WANs, we increased the scope. Going the other way, a personal area network (PAN) is going to be much smaller in scale. The term PAN is most commonly used in reference to Bluetooth networks. In 1998, a consortium of companies formed the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) and formally adopted the name Bluetooth for its technology. The name comes from a tenth-century Danish king named Harald Blåtand, known as Harold Bluetooth in English. (One can only imagine how he got that name.) King Blåtand had successfully unified warring factions in the areas of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. The makers of Bluetooth were trying to unite disparate technology industries, namely computing, mobile communications, and the auto industry.

> Although the most common use of a PAN is in association with Bluetooth, a PAN can also be created with other technologies, such as infrared.

Current membership in the Bluetooth SIG includes Microsoft, Intel, Apple, IBM, Toshiba, and several cell phone manufacturers. The technical specification IEEE 802.15.1 describes a wireless personal area network (WPAN) based on Bluetooth version 1.1.

The first Bluetooth device on the market was an Ericsson headset and cell phone adapter, which arrived on the scene in 2000. While mobile phones and accessories are still the most common type of Bluetooth device, you will find many more, including wireless keyboards, mice, and printers. Figure 2.21 shows a Bluetooth USB adapter.

One of the defining features of a Bluetooth WPAN is its temporary nature. With traditional Wi-Fi, you need a central communication point, such as a wireless router or access point, to connect more than two devices together. (This is referred to as infrastructure.) Bluetooth networks are formed on an ad hoc basis, meaning that whenever two Bluetooth devices get close enough to each other, they can communicate directly with each other—no central communication point is required. This dynamically created network is called a piconet. A Bluetooth-enabled device can communicate with up to seven other devices in one piconet. Two or more piconets can be linked together in a scatternet. In a scatternet, one or more devices would serve as a bridge between the piconets.

# Return on investment (ROI)

Return on Investment (ROI) is a financial metric used to evaluate the profitability of an investment or compare the efficiency of several different investments. It measures the return or profit generated relative to the cost of the investment, expressed as a percentage. ROI is widely used in business and finance to assess whether a specific project or initiative is worth pursuing.

ROI is calculated by subtracting the cost of the investment from the return, then dividing that number by the cost of the investment. A higher ROI indicates a more favorable investment, while a negative ROI suggests that the investment resulted in a loss.

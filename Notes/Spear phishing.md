[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

Spear phishing is a targeted form of phishing where attackers tailor their deceptive messages to a specific individual or organization, often using personalized information to increase the likelihood of success. Unlike broad-based phishing attacks that are sent to large groups of people, spear phishing campaigns focus on a select few, often using information gathered from social media, corporate websites, or other publicly available sources. The goal is to manipulate the victim into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial data, or corporate secrets.

Attackers typically pose as trusted entities, such as colleagues, bosses, or well-known vendors, and use information about the victim's job role, interests, or personal relationships to craft highly convincing messages. Spear phishing is often used as the first step in larger attacks, such as installing malware or gaining unauthorized access to secure systems.

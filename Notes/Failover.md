# Failover

A failover strategy is critical because system failures are often inevitableâ€”it's not a matter of if but when. The goal is to ensure that services continue to operate smoothly even when one component fails.

To prepare for failure, organizations create a redundant infrastructure. This involves setting up multiple routers, firewalls, switches, and other key devices. By having backups in place, the system can quickly switch to an operational unit if one component stops working.

Failover mechanisms are often automated, allowing for seamless transitions without requiring manual intervention. This ensures minimal disruption to services, providing continuity even during unexpected failures.

# Wildcard (SQL)

[[🏷️SQL]]

A wildcard is a special character that can be substituted with any other character. Two of the most useful wildcards are the percentage sign (`%`) and the underscore (`_`):

- The percentage sign substitutes for any number of other characters.
- The underscore symbol only substitutes for one other character.

The following table includes these wildcards applied to the string `a` and examples of what each pattern could return.

# Managed service provider (MSP)

A managed service provider (MSP) is a third-party organization that remotely manages an organization's IT infrastructure, systems, and end-user services. MSPs provide ongoing support, monitoring, and maintenance to ensure optimal performance, security, and reliability of IT systems. They help businesses streamline operations, reduce downtime, and focus on their core functions by outsourcing IT needs.

- **IT infrastructure management:** MSPs handle the setup, monitoring, and maintenance of servers, networks, and workstations, ensuring that all components operate efficiently.
- **Helpdesk support:** MSPs provide technical support to end users, resolving issues related to hardware, software, and connectivity.
- **Proactive monitoring:** MSPs continuously monitor IT systems to identify and resolve potential problems before they lead to downtime or security breaches.
- **Backup and disaster recovery:** MSPs implement and manage data backup solutions and disaster recovery plans, ensuring data integrity and business continuity in the event of an incident.
- **Cost predictability:** MSPs typically operate on a subscription-based model, providing businesses with predictable IT costs and reducing the need for large upfront investments in IT infrastructure.
- **Security management:** MSPs offer cybersecurity services, such as patch management, endpoint protection, and vulnerability assessments, to safeguard systems from threats.

MSPs play a critical role in modern business operations, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that lack the resources to manage IT systems in-house. By outsourcing IT management to an MSP, organizations can enhance efficiency, security, and scalability while focusing on their strategic goals.

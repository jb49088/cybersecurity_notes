# NetFlow

NetFlow is a network traffic analysis technology developed by Cisco that collects and analyzes traffic flow data. It provides valuable insights into network activity by tracking the flow of data between devices, including information like source and destination IP addresses, ports, and the amount of data transferred. NetFlow helps administrators monitor network performance, optimize traffic management, and identify potential security issues by capturing detailed traffic statistics.

Key features of NetFlow:

- **Gathering traffic statistics from all traffic flows**: NetFlow collects detailed statistics about all data flows, such as the volume, type, and duration of communication between devices.
- **Standard collection method**: NetFlow provides a standardized method for capturing traffic flow data, supported by various network devices and products.
- **Probe and collector**: A **probe** watches network communication, capturing flow data, and sends summary records to a **collector**. The collector aggregates and processes this data for analysis.
- **Reporting application**: The collector is typically connected to a separate reporting application, which processes the collected data to generate reports, visualizations, and insights into network performance and traffic patterns.

NetFlow is an essential tool for network monitoring and analysis, offering network administrators a way to better understand traffic patterns, troubleshoot issues, and enhance network security.

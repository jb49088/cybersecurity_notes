# On-path attack

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork attack]]

An on-path attack, previously referred to as a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, is a method where an attacker intercepts and potentially manipulates communication between two parties without their knowledge. This type of attack involves redirecting traffic through the attacker‚Äôs system before forwarding it to its intended destination, making it appear as though the communication is uninterrupted and secure.

In an on-path attack, the victim remains unaware that their traffic has been intercepted, as the attacker ensures smooth communication between the original sender and receiver. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on sensitive information, such as login credentials, or inject malicious content into the communication stream.

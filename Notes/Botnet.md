# Botnet

[[üè∑Ô∏èMalware]] 

Botnets are networks of infected computers controlled remotely by attackers, used for malicious activities like launching DDoS attacks, sending spam, and spreading malware. They can also be used to store illegal files, as the distributed nature of botnets makes it harder to detect and shut down illicit content. Additionally, botnets hijack system resources to mine cryptocurrency and use the combined processing power of infected devices to crack encryption, enabling brute-force attacks on sensitive data.

[[üè∑Ô∏èMalware]] 

An armor virus is a type of virus that is specifically designed to protect itself from detection and removal by security software or antivirus programs. It does this by using various techniques such as encryption, polymorphism, or anti-debugging methods to make itself harder to analyze or reverse-engineer. Armor viruses may modify their structure or hide within other legitimate files, making it challenging for traditional antivirus tools to identify and remove them. This form of malware is often used in advanced attacks, such as targeted campaigns against high-value systems or data.

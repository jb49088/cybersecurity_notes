[[üè∑Ô∏èKey exchange protocol]]

Internet key exchange (IKE) is a protocol used to establish and manage secure communications between two devices over an IP network. it is a fundamental component of IPsec (internet protocol security) and is responsible for negotiating encryption keys, authentication, and security associations (SAs) between endpoints.

- **Secure key exchange**: IKE automates the process of securely exchanging cryptographic keys between devices.
- **Authentication**: uses methods like pre-shared keys, digital certificates, or RSA signatures to verify identities.
- **Two phases**: IKE operates in two distinct phases to establish a secure communication channel.
- **IKE versions**: IKEv1 is the original version, while IKEv2 improves efficiency, security, and resilience to attacks.

IKE is essential for securing VPNs (virtual private networks), ensuring encrypted and authenticated communication over untrusted networks like the internet.

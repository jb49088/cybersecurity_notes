[[üè∑Ô∏èPassword attack]]

A dictionary attack is a type of brute force attack where an attacker attempts to guess a password by systematically entering words from a predefined list (the "dictionary"). This list typically contains common passwords, phrases, and variations, which may include dictionary words, common names, or frequently used passwords. The goal is to find a match to the target's password without testing every possible combination.

Unlike a traditional brute force attack, which tries all possible combinations of characters, a dictionary attack narrows the possibilities by focusing on words and patterns that people are more likely to use. This makes it faster than a brute force attack, but it still relies on the fact that the target has chosen a weak or common password.

To defend against dictionary attacks, it‚Äôs crucial to use strong, complex passwords that combine letters, numbers, and symbols, and to enable account lockout mechanisms or multi-factor authentication (MFA) to limit the success of these attacks.

# Identity proofing

Identity proofing is the process of verifying that an individual or entity is who they claim to be within an Identity and Access Management (IAM) framework. It establishes trust in the authenticity of a userâ€™s identity before granting access to systems or resources.

- **Confirms user identity:** Ensures that a person or entity is accurately identified and not impersonating someone else.
- **Establishes resolution:** Matches the user's claimed identity with existing records or profiles in the system.
- **Validates user-provided information:** Confirms identity through details like passwords, security questions, or personal data.
- **Uses verification methods:** Incorporates stronger checks like passports, in-person verification, or automated tools such as biometric scanning.
- **Supports automated verification:** Implements modern solutions like online document scanning or AI-based identity checks for efficiency.

Identity proofing is a critical step in securing access, protecting sensitive information, and ensuring compliance with organizational policies and regulatory requirements.

# Private branch exchange (PBX)

A private branch exchange (PBX) is a telephone system used within an organization to manage internal and external calls. It allows users to communicate internally without routing calls through the public telephone network while also providing access to external phone lines when needed. PBX systems help businesses efficiently handle large volumes of calls, offering features like call forwarding, voicemail, and conferencing.

- **Traditional PBX:** Uses physical phone lines and hardware to connect internal and external calls.
- **IP PBX:** Uses internet protocol (IP) networks to route calls, often integrating with VoIP services.
- **Hosted PBX:** A cloud-based system managed by a third-party provider, reducing on-premises hardware requirements.
- **Cost savings:** Reduces the need for multiple phone lines by allowing internal calls without external charges.
- **Scalability:** Can support a growing number of users and features as business needs evolve.
- **Advanced call management:** Features like automated attendants, voicemail-to-email, and call routing improve communication efficiency.

PBX systems remain a critical component of business communications, especially in environments that require reliable and scalable voice solutions.

[[üè∑Ô∏èPhysical security]]

Security guards are personnel employed to protect people, property, and information by monitoring, deterring, and responding to potential threats. As a critical component of physical security, they provide a human presence that complements technological controls like surveillance systems and access control mechanisms.

Security guards perform various tasks, including patrolling premises, checking credentials, managing access points, and monitoring surveillance equipment. They are trained to detect suspicious activity, de-escalate conflicts, and respond to emergencies such as theft, vandalism, or safety hazards. Guards may be stationed at fixed locations, such as entrances, or assigned to rove across a site to ensure comprehensive coverage.

In addition to deterring unauthorized access, security guards play a proactive role in fostering a safe environment by assisting visitors, enforcing rules, and serving as a point of contact during incidents. They are often deployed in high-security environments, such as government facilities, financial institutions, and event venues, but their presence is also common in residential and commercial settings.

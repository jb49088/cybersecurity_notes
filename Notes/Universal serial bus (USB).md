Universal serial bus (USB) is a widely used standard for connecting devices to computers and other electronic systems. It defines the cables, connectors, and protocols for data transfer and power supply between devices. Initially developed in the mid-1990s, USB has become the standard interface for a wide range of peripherals, including keyboards, mice, printers, external storage devices, smartphones, and more.

USB allows for plug-and-play functionality, enabling devices to be easily connected or disconnected without restarting the computer. It supports both data transfer and power delivery, making it a versatile solution for various applications. There are different versions of USB, each offering faster speeds and improved capabilities:

- USB 1.1 and 2.0: Older versions, with USB 2.0 offering data transfer rates of up to 480 Mbps.

- USB 3.x: Introduced higher transfer speeds, with USB 3.0 offering up to 5 Gbps and USB 3.1 reaching 10 Gbps.

- USB4: The latest version, offering speeds of up to 40 Gbps, while also supporting Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C connectors.

USB has become a crucial part of everyday computing, providing a universal and reliable way to connect and power devices across many different platforms.

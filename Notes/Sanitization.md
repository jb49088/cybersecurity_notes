# Sanitization

Sanitization is the process of securely removing or destroying data to prevent unauthorized access or recovery. It is a critical practice for maintaining data confidentiality, especially when disposing of or repurposing storage devices.

There are several methods of sanitization, depending on the level of security required and the type of media being sanitized:

- **Clearing**: Overwriting data to make it difficult to recover through standard means. This is suitable for repurposing storage devices within the same organization.
- **Purging**: More thorough than clearing, purging ensures data cannot be recovered using advanced forensic techniques. This may involve multiple overwrites or cryptographic erasure.
- **Destroying**: Physically destroying the media to render it completely unusable. Methods include shredding, degaussing, or incineration.

Proper sanitization is essential for protecting sensitive information and complying with data security regulations. Organizations must follow industry best practices and standards, such as those outlined by NIST and DoD, to ensure data is irretrievable before disposing of storage media.

[[🏷️Business agreement]]

A business partners agreement (BPA) is a formal contract that defines the terms and responsibilities for individuals or entities entering a partnership. It ensures clarity and prepares for potential challenges in the business relationship.

- **Going into business together:** Establishes ownership stakes and financial contributions for each partner.
- **Financial contract:** Outlines how profits, losses, and expenses will be divided.
- **Decision-making:** Identifies who makes business decisions and the scope of their authority. Specific individuals are listed in the agreement.
- **Prepare for contingencies:** Plans for financial challenges and disaster recovery to ensure the partnership's resilience.

By creating a BPA, partners can avoid misunderstandings, streamline decision-making, and protect the business against unforeseen issues.

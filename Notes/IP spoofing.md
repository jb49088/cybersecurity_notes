[[🏷️Network attack]]

IP spoofing is a technique used by attackers to falsify the source IP address in a packet header to disguise their identity or impersonate another computer system. This technique can be employed for various malicious purposes, including hiding the origin of an attack, bypassing access controls, or launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

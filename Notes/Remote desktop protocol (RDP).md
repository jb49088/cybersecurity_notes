# Remote desktop protocol (RDP)

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork protocol]]

Remote desktop protocol (RDP) is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that enables remote access to a computer over a network. It allows users to control a remote system as if they were physically present, providing access to files, applications, and system settings.

- **Port number and protocol type:** RDP operates over port 3389 using TCP and optionally UDP for improved performance.
- **Encryption:** RDP uses SSL/TLS encryption to secure remote connections, protecting data from eavesdropping and unauthorized access.
- **Authentication:** RDP supports various authentication methods, including password-based login, smart cards, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
- **Graphical interface:** RDP transmits a graphical user interface (GUI) of the remote system, allowing users to interact with it as if they were physically at the machine.
- **Session management:** Multiple users can connect to a single RDP-enabled server, with administrators able to monitor, shadow, or terminate sessions as needed.
- **Security concerns:** RDP is a common target for cyberattacks, including brute-force attacks and ransomware distribution. Best practices include using strong passwords, enabling network-level authentication (NLA), and restricting access through firewalls and VPNs.

RDP is widely used in business environments for remote work, IT support, and server administration.

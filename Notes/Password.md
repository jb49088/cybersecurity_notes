[[üè∑Ô∏èAuthentication methods]]

Passwords are a fundamental and widely used method for authenticating users in digital environments. They act as a primary barrier against unauthorized access, requiring users to input a secret combination of characters to verify their identity.

Setting password requirements was historically one of the few controls available to help protect passwords from brute-force attacks and to help handle the issue of stolen, reused, or otherwise exposed passwords. Common password settings found in most operating systems and many services support configuration options for passwords, including:

- Length, which has typically been one of the best controls to prevent password brute forcing.
  <br>
- Complexity, which influences password attacks by ensuring that larger character sets are required for brute-force attacks and in many implementations, also prevents the use of common words or a series of repeated characters.
  <br>
- Reuse limitations are set to ensure that users don't simply set their password to a previous password, which may have been exposed, reused, or compromised.
  <br>
- Expiration dates are set to ensure that passwords are not used for extended periods of time. Expiration dates often create additional support work for help desks, which means many organizations have moved to not requiring password changes as frequently‚Äîor ever‚Äîif they have MFA in place.
  <br>
- Age settings for passwords are used to ensure that users do not simply reset their passwords over and over until they bypass reuse limitations, allowing them to return to their former password.

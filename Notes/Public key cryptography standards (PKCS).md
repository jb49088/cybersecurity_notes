# Public key cryptography standards (PKCS)

Public key cryptography standards (PKCS) are a set of cryptographic standards developed by RSA Security to ensure interoperability in public key infrastructure (PKI) implementations. These standards define protocols for encryption, digital signatures, and key management, enabling secure communication and data protection.

PKCS covers various aspects of cryptographic operations, with some of the most widely used standards including:

- **PKCS #1:** Defines the RSA encryption and signature algorithms.
- **PKCS #7:** Specifies the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) for secure data transmission, often used in digital signatures.
- **PKCS #10:** Outlines the format for certificate signing requests (CSR), used when requesting digital certificates from a certificate authority (CA).
- **PKCS #12:** Defines a format for securely storing and transporting cryptographic keys, certificates, and other sensitive data.
- **PKCS #11:** Establishes a standard API for cryptographic tokens, such as hardware security modules (HSMs) and smart cards.

PKCS plays a crucial role in securing communications, authenticating users, and ensuring data integrity across various applications, including SSL/TLS, email security, and digital signatures.

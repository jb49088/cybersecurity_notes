# Decoy directories

Decoy directories are a cybersecurity technique used to mislead attackers by creating fake directories or paths on a system, network, or web application. These directories appear legitimate but are intentionally designed to trap and monitor unauthorized access attempts. When attackers attempt to navigate through or exploit these decoy directories, their actions can be detected, tracked, and analyzed to understand their tactics.

Decoy directories are typically part of a broader deception strategy, such as honeypots or honeytokens, aimed at luring attackers into interacting with decoy systems or assets rather than the real critical infrastructure. By introducing these false paths, organizations can divert attention away from valuable resources and increase the likelihood of identifying malicious activities early on.

[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

Baiting is a type of social engineering attack where cybercriminals lure victims into taking a specific action by offering something enticing, such as free downloads, software, or other rewards. The goal is to "bait" the victim into performing a task (like downloading malware or revealing sensitive information) under the assumption that they are receiving something of value. Baiting can take many forms, including fake giveaways, free software downloads, or even tempting offers in the form of email attachments or links.

Unlike other types of phishing attacks, which primarily rely on deceptive communication, baiting preys on human curiosity and desire for free or discounted items. Once the victim takes the bait, the attacker can exploit the victim's system, steal personal data, or infect the device with malicious software.

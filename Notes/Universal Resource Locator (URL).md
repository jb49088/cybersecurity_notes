# Universal resource locator (URL)

A universal resource locator (URL) is a reference used to locate a resource on the internet. It specifies the protocol, domain, and path required to access a web page or other resource.

Structure of a URL:

- **Protocol:** Defines the method of access (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS).
- **Domain:** Identifies the server hosting the resource.
- **Path:** Specifies the location of the resource on the server.

URLs are a foundational component of the World Wide Web, enabling efficient resource identification and access.

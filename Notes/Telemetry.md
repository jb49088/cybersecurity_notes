# Telemetry

Telemetry is the process of collecting and transmitting data from remote or distributed systems to a central location for monitoring, analysis, and decision-making. In technology and cybersecurity, telemetry allows organizations to gather insights about system performance, security events, and user activity to ensure optimal operation and identify potential issues.

- **Data collection**: Telemetry systems gather data from various sources, such as servers, devices, applications, and sensors, including metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic, and error rates.
- **Real-time monitoring**: Telemetry often operates in real-time, providing continuous feedback to administrators and security teams to quickly identify anomalies or signs of a potential attack.
- **Centralized analysis**: The collected data is transmitted to a central server or cloud service where it is analyzed, visualized, and used for troubleshooting, performance optimization, or detecting security breaches.
- **Security monitoring**: In cybersecurity, telemetry can help detect suspicious activity, malware infections, and network intrusions by tracking unusual patterns of system behavior or user actions.
- **Privacy considerations**: Telemetry data may include sensitive information, so it is essential to implement proper data encryption, anonymization, and access controls to prevent unauthorized access.

Telemetry plays a critical role in system administration and cybersecurity, enabling proactive monitoring, quick issue resolution, and informed decision-making.

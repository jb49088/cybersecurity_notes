Asset classification is the process of categorizing assets based on their characteristics, use, or financial value. It helps organizations organize and manage their resources more effectively, allowing for better tracking, reporting, and decision-making. Assets can be classified into various types, such as physical, digital, financial, and intangible assets. This classification is essential for financial reporting, risk management, and efficient asset management.

# Root of trust

The root of trust is a fundamental concept in IT security, acting as an inherently trusted component that establishes and maintains the trustworthiness of a system. Since all security mechanisms rely on trust as a foundational principle, the root of trust serves as the initial point from which this trust is built and extended.

## Building Trust

Establishing trust involves introducing a reliable entity or component that can validate unknown entities. This process ensures that security mechanisms function correctly and securely. The root of trust can reside in hardware, software, firmware, or a combination of these elements.

Examples of trusted components include:

- **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)**: Physical devices designed to manage cryptographic keys and secure sensitive operations.
- **Secure Enclaves**: Isolated hardware-based execution environments ensuring data protection.
- **Certificate Authorities (CAs)**: Trusted entities responsible for issuing and managing digital certificates.

## Importance

The root of trust forms the backbone of security architectures, ensuring that all subsequent security decisions, such as authentication, encryption, and validation, are based on a trusted source. By leveraging components like HSMs or CAs, systems can achieve robust protection against tampering, unauthorized access, and other threats.

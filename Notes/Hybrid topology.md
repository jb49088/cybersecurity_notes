# Hybrid Topology

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork topology]]

The hybrid topology is simply a mix of the other topologies. It would be impossible to illus- trate it because there are many combinations. In fact, most networks today are not only hybrid but heterogeneous. (They include a mix of components of different types and brands.) The hybrid network may be more expensive than some types of network topologies, but it takes the best features of all the other topologies and exploits them. Table 5.1, summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each type of network topology.

[[üè∑Ô∏èPolicy]]

An acceptable use policy (AUP) outlines the guidelines and rules for using an organization's assets and resources. It ensures that employees, contractors, and other stakeholders understand the proper use of these resources, protecting the organization from misuse and potential liability.

- **Defines acceptable use:** Specifies what constitutes appropriate use of company assets, such as internet access, telephones, computers, and mobile devices.
- **Detailed documentation:** Provides clear and detailed guidance, often documented in the organization's Rules of Behavior or similar frameworks.
- **Covers a range of topics:** Includes rules for internet use, email communication, software installations, social media conduct, and handling sensitive data.
- **Limits legal liability:** Serves as a basis for disciplinary actions or termination in cases of misconduct, offering a well-documented rationale for the organization's decisions.
- **Employee acknowledgment:** Often requires employees to read and sign the policy, confirming their understanding and agreement to comply.

An AUP is a critical component of an organization's governance, promoting responsible behavior and safeguarding resources from misuse.

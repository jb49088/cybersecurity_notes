# Command line interface (CLI)

A command line interface (CLI) is a text-based interface used to interact with an operating system or software by typing commands. Unlike graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which rely on visual elements like icons and menus, CLIs allow users to execute commands directly, making them a powerful tool for system administration, automation, and troubleshooting.

- **Direct control**: CLIs provide users with precise control over a system by executing commands, scripts, and batch processes without relying on a graphical interface.
- **Efficiency and automation**: Many tasks can be completed more quickly using CLI commands, especially when automating repetitive actions with scripts.
- **Common CLI environments**: Popular CLIs include Bash (Linux/macOS), Command Prompt (Windows), PowerShell (Windows), and Zsh (Linux/macOS).
- **Remote administration**: CLI tools like SSH (Secure Shell) enable administrators to manage remote systems securely.
- **Extensibility**: Many CLIs support scripting languages like Bash, Python, or PowerShell, allowing users to automate complex workflows.
    

CLIs remain an essential tool for IT professionals, developers, and cybersecurity experts, offering flexibility, speed, and powerful control over computing environments.

# Hot site

[[üè∑Ô∏èRisk management]]

A hot site is a disaster recovery solution that serves as an exact replica of an organization's primary site, designed to ensure business continuity in the event of a major disruption. It includes duplicate hardware, software, and infrastructure, providing a fully operational environment that can take over operations with minimal downtime.

Hot sites are stocked with all the necessary hardware, configured identically to the primary site, and are continuously updated to mirror changes. This approach requires organizations to invest in duplicate systems and maintain them regularly, effectively requiring "two of everything."

Applications and software at the hot site are kept synchronized with the primary site through automated replication processes. This ensures that all data and systems are up to date, allowing for a seamless transition when needed.

In the event of a disaster or failure at the primary site, the hot site can take over operations almost immediately. While the switch to the hot site may involve multiple steps or configurations, the process is designed to be efficient and minimize disruption.

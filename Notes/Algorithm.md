# Algorithm

A set of rules used to solve a problem by breaking it down into logical steps.

- **Foundational for computing:** Algorithms are the building blocks of computer programs. They are essential for everything computers do, from basic calculations to complex tasks like [[Artificial Intelligence (AI)|AI]] and [[ML|ML]].

- **Problem-solving approach:** Algorithms provide a structured way to approach problems and develop solutions. They ensure a clear and efficient path to reach the desired outcome.

- **Efficiency matters:** Different algorithms can solve the same problem, but some are more efficient than others. Efficiency considers factors like time complexity (how long it takes) and space complexity (how much memory it uses).

- **Continuous development:** The field of algorithm design is constantly evolving as new problems arise and new technologies emerge. There's ongoing research to develop more efficient and effective algorithms.

# Near field communication (NFC)

Near Field Communication (NFC) is a short-range wireless technology that enables devices to exchange data when brought close together, typically within a range of 4 inches (10 cm). NFC operates at high frequencies (13.56 MHz) and is commonly used for contactless payments, public transportation, ticketing systems, and pairing devices.

Like RFID, NFC uses electromagnetic fields to transmit data, but it is designed for more secure and user-friendly applications. NFC technology is often embedded in smartphones, smartwatches, and other mobile devices, allowing users to make payments or share information with a simple tap.

While NFC is considered more secure than traditional RFID due to its short communication range and encryption capabilities, it is not immune to security risks. Attackers could potentially exploit NFC systems through techniques such as eavesdropping, data interception, or relay attacks, where the communication between two devices is intercepted and relayed to a third-party device. To mitigate these risks, NFC systems often use secure encryption and authentication protocols.

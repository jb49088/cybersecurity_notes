# Service set identifier (SSID)

A service set identifier (SSID) is a unique name assigned to a wireless local area network (WLAN). The SSID helps identify and distinguish one network from another, allowing devices to connect to the appropriate network. When an access point (AP) broadcasts its SSID, nearby devices can see the network and choose to connect, assuming they have the correct credentials (if needed).

- **Unique network identifier**: The SSID serves as the primary identifier for wireless networks, ensuring that devices can differentiate between multiple networks in the same physical area.
- **Broadcasting**: Access points typically broadcast their SSID to make the network discoverable by nearby devices. However, SSIDs can be hidden, requiring manual entry of the network name to establish a connection.
- **Case-sensitive**: SSIDs are case-sensitive, so "Network" and "network" are treated as distinct SSIDs.
- **Length**: The SSID can be up to 32 characters long, offering flexibility in naming conventions for different types of networks.

There are different types of SSIDs. A Public SSID is an open network that allows devices to connect without a password, often found in public spaces like coffee shops or airports. A Private SSID is encrypted and requires a password, typically used in home or business environments. A Hidden SSID doesn’t broadcast its name, requiring manual entry to connect. While it adds security, it can still be detected by determined attackers.

For SSID management, it's important to change the default SSID to something unique to prevent easy identification by attackers. Using WPA3 security ensures strong encryption to protect the network. Lastly, consider SSID visibility—hiding it can reduce detection, but may complicate connections for legitimate users, so weigh the security benefits carefully.

By configuring the SSID properly and adhering to best practices, network administrators can help ensure the security and proper functioning of wireless networks.

# Subscriber identity module (SIM)

A subscriber identity module (SIM) is a small, removable card used in mobile devices to securely store information that identifies and authenticates a subscriber on a cellular network. It enables users to connect to their carrierâ€™s network for voice, text, and data services.

SIM cards store:

- Subscriber Identity Information: Such as the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI).
- Authentication Keys: For securing communication with the network.
- Carrier-Specific Data: Including network settings and phone number information.

There are several types of SIM cards, including traditional SIM, Micro-SIM, Nano-SIM, and embedded SIM (eSIM), each progressively smaller or integrated into devices. The SIM ensures portability, allowing users to switch between devices or carriers while retaining their subscription details.

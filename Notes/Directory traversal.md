# Directory traversal

[[üè∑Ô∏èWeb application attack]]

Directory traversal, also known as path traversal, is an attack that allows an attacker to read files from a web server outside the website‚Äôs intended directory. This type of attack typically occurs when users are able to access system files, such as files in the Windows folder, which they shouldn't be able to browse.

This vulnerability can arise from web server software flaws that don't properly restrict access to files outside the web server's root directory. Additionally, poorly written web application code can enable attackers to manipulate file paths and traverse beyond the intended file structure, allowing them to access sensitive files or configuration data.

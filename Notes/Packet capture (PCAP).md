# Packet capture (PCAP)

Packet capture (PCAP) is a valuable tool for analyzing network traffic, helping to identify issues, verify security measures, and troubleshoot applications.

- **Solve complex application issues:** Packet captures allow you to dive into network traffic details, helping to diagnose and fix complex application-related problems.
- **Gathers packets on the network or in the air:** PCAP tools can capture data from physical network interfaces or wirelessly. Some devices include built-in packet capture capabilities for ease of monitoring.
- **View detailed traffic information:** Packet captures offer a deep look into network traffic, helping to identify unknown or suspicious traffic patterns, verify packet filtering, and assess security controls.
- **Analyze application data:** PCAP tools can translate raw packet data into a more understandable, plain-language description, offering insights into the specific application data being transmitted.

Packet captures are essential for network troubleshooting and enhancing the security posture of an organization by providing detailed visibility into network activity.

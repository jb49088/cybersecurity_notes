# Short message service (SMS)

Short message service (SMS) is a text messaging protocol that allows users to send and receive short text-based messages over mobile networks. It is one of the most widely used forms of communication and operates independently of internet access.

- **Character limit:** SMS messages are limited to 160 characters per message. Longer messages are split into multiple segments and reassembled by the recipientâ€™s device.
- **Network-based delivery:** SMS is transmitted through cellular networks, allowing messages to be sent and received even without an internet connection.
- **Global compatibility:** SMS is supported by virtually all mobile devices and carriers worldwide, making it a universal messaging standard.
- **Reliability:** Messages are typically delivered instantly but may be delayed due to network congestion or poor signal conditions.
- **Use in authentication:** SMS is commonly used for two-factor authentication (2FA) and security notifications, though it has vulnerabilities such as SIM swapping and interception.

Despite the rise of internet-based messaging apps, SMS remains a crucial communication tool, particularly for emergency alerts, authentication codes, and basic text messaging.

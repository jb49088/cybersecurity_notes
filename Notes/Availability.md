# Availability

Availability refers to the uptime of a system, meaning the ability to access data, complete transactions, and ensure continuous service. It is one of the fundamental aspects of IT security, as users must be able to reliably access resources when needed. Ensuring high availability often involves balancing between providing access to legitimate users while protecting against unauthorized access.

Achieving high availability typically requires considerable investment in monitoring systems, redundant hardware, and failover mechanisms. Businesses often dedicate significant time and resources to maintain uptime, as it can impact revenue, customer trust, and overall system performance.

An important metric for assessing the effectiveness of an IT infrastructure is its availability. Systems are commonly evaluated based on their uptime and the total available time, often tracked and measured as a percentage, such as 99.99% uptime.

# Honeynet

A honeynet is a collection of interconnected honeypots, designed to simulate an entire network environment rather than just a single system. It is used in cybersecurity to attract, observe, and analyze attackers by providing a more realistic and complex decoy environment. The goal of a honeynet is to deceive attackers into interacting with multiple interconnected systems that appear to be a legitimate, vulnerable network while being carefully monitored and isolated from real systems.

By using multiple honeypots within a honeynet, security professionals can gather detailed information about attack techniques, tools, and methods used by cybercriminals. Honeynets are especially useful for studying large-scale or sophisticated attacks, as they allow for better analysis of the attacker's behavior across different systems and services.

Honeynets provide an effective way to understand the tactics and strategies of attackers, detect emerging threats, and strengthen defenses without directly exposing real network infrastructure to risk.

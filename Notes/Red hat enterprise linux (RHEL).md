- **Enterprise-grade stability**: RHEL undergoes extensive testing to ensure reliability, making it a trusted choice for critical workloads.
- **Long-term support (LTS)**: Each major RHEL release receives security updates and maintenance for up to **10 years**, ensuring long-term viability for businesses.
- **Security and compliance**: RHEL includes security-focused features such as **SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)**, system-wide cryptographic policies, and compliance tools for regulations like **FedRAMP** and **HIPAA**.
- **Subscription-based model**: Unlike community-based distributions, RHEL requires a paid subscription that provides access to official updates, security patches, and enterprise support.
- **Performance optimization**: RHEL is tuned for high-performance computing, supporting enterprise workloads like databases, virtualization, and cloud deployments.
- **Red Hat ecosystem**: RHEL integrates with **Red Hat OpenShift**, **Red Hat Ansible Automation**, and other Red Hat solutions to streamline IT operations.
- **CentOS and Fedora connection**: **CentOS Stream** serves as an upstream development branch for RHEL, while **Fedora** acts as a testing ground for new features before they reach enterprise environments.

RHEL is widely used in industries requiring high availability, security, and support, including finance, healthcare, and cloud services.

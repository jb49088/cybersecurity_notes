# Logic bomb

[[üè∑Ô∏èMalware]] 

A logic bomb is a type of malicious code that is triggered by a specific condition or event, such as a particular date or action. Unlike other malware that spreads immediately, a logic bomb remains dormant until the predefined trigger occurs. Once activated, it can cause various harmful effects, such as deleting files, corrupting data, or disrupting system operations.

Logic bombs are often hidden within legitimate software or systems and can be challenging to detect until they are triggered. They are commonly used by cybercriminals for targeted attacks or by insiders seeking to cause harm or disruption. Since they are condition-based, their effects can be delayed, making them difficult to identify before activation.

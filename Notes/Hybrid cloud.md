# Hybrid cloud

A hybrid cloud combines multiple cloud environments, such as public and private clouds, into a unified system. This approach offers flexibility and scalability but also introduces additional complexity in managing and securing the environment.

The integration of different cloud platforms often results in challenges like mismatched network protection mechanisms. Variations in authentication protocols, firewall configurations, and server settings between environments can create vulnerabilities. Security monitoring becomes more complex as logs are diverse and tailored to specific cloud platforms, complicating incident detection and response.

One significant risk in hybrid cloud environments is data leakage. Data often moves between public and private clouds, increasing exposure to potential breaches as it traverses the public Internet. Organizations must implement robust encryption, monitoring, and access controls to mitigate these risks.

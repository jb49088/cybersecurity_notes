# PowerShell

PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework developed by Microsoft. It consists of a command-line shell and an associated scripting language built on the .NET platform. PowerShell is designed to help IT professionals and power users automate system administration tasks and manage configurations across Windows, Linux, and macOS environments.

- **Command-line shell:** PowerShell provides an interactive shell where users can run commands, scripts, and manage system resources.
- **Object-oriented scripting:** Unlike traditional shells that work with text streams, PowerShell uses objects, allowing more powerful and flexible manipulation of data.
- **Cmdlets:** PowerShell commands, called cmdlets, perform specific functions such as managing files, services, processes, and system settings.
- **Extensibility:** Users can create custom cmdlets, functions, and modules, and integrate with .NET libraries and external tools.
- **Cross-platform support:** Modern PowerShell versions run on Windows, Linux, and macOS, providing a consistent automation experience across different operating systems.

PowerShell has become a standard tool for system administrators and developers aiming to automate tasks, manage cloud environments, and simplify complex workflows.

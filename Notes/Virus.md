# Virus

A virus is a type of malicious software (malware) designed to replicate itself and spread from one computer or device to another, often causing harm in the process. Viruses can attach themselves to legitimate programs or files, which, when executed, enable the virus to spread. The goal of a virus is often to corrupt or delete data, take control of system resources, or disrupt normal system operations. Unlike other types of malware, viruses generally require user interaction, such as opening an infected email attachment or running a compromised file, to spread.

# Extended detection and response (XDR)

Extended detection and response (XDR) is an advanced evolution of endpoint detection and response (EDR) that improves the scope and effectiveness of threat detection and response across multiple security layers. XDR integrates data from endpoints, networks, and the cloud to provide more comprehensive threat intelligence and faster incident response.

- **Enhancement of EDR:** XDR builds on the foundation of EDR by addressing limitations such as missed detections, false positives, and long investigation times. It extends the reach beyond endpoints to provide more accurate and timely security insights.
- **Beyond endpoint-focused protection:** While EDR primarily focuses on detecting threats at the endpoint level, XDR expands the detection capabilities to include network-based anomalies and cloud environments, recognizing that modern attacks often span multiple layers.
- **Network-based detection:** XDR adds network-based detection to identify unusual network activities, which can provide additional context for identifying and responding to threats.
- **Data correlation across layers:** XDR correlates data from endpoints, network traffic, and cloud environments to improve detection rates and reduce security event investigation complexity. By combining these data points, XDR enables security teams to gain a broader view of threats and respond more effectively.

XDR is a powerful tool for organizations looking to enhance their threat detection and response capabilities, offering a unified solution to detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents across all areas of the network.

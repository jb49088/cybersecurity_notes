[[üè∑Ô∏èAuthentication methods]]

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) enhances security by requiring multiple methods to verify your identity, making it more difficult for unauthorized access. MFA combines different authentication factors to ensure that you are who you claim to be.

- **Something you know:** Includes a password, a PIN, or a pattern.
- **Something you have:** Involves physical devices like a smart card, USB security key, or phone, or software tokens that generate authentication codes.
- **Something you are:** Biometric data like fingerprints, voice prints, or iris scans, stored as a mathematical representation.
- **Somewhere you are:** Location-based factors like your IP address or mobile device‚Äôs GPS data.

MFA improves security by combining multiple authentication factors, making it more challenging for attackers to bypass. It also adapts to different environments and security needs.

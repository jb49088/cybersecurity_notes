# Zero trust

[[üè∑Ô∏èPrinciple]]

Zero trust is a security model that assumes no entity‚Äîwhether inside or outside the network‚Äîshould be trusted by default. Instead of relying on traditional perimeter-based security, zero trust enforces strict identity verification, least privilege access, and continuous monitoring to protect data, systems, and users from potential threats.

- **Verify every user and device**: Access is granted based on authentication, authorization, and risk assessment, rather than assuming trust based on location or network position.
- **Least privilege access**: Users and devices are only given the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Microsegmentation**: Networks are divided into smaller segments to limit lateral movement, so attackers cannot easily spread if they gain access to one part of the system.
- **Continuous monitoring and logging**: Activity is continuously tracked to detect and respond to suspicious behavior in real time.
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**: Additional verification steps beyond just usernames and passwords help ensure secure access.

Zero trust is widely adopted in modern cybersecurity frameworks, particularly in cloud environments and remote work scenarios, where traditional security models are insufficient to defend against evolving threats.

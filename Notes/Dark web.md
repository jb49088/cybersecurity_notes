# Dark web

The dark web is a part of the internet that is intentionally hidden and requires specialized software, configurations, or access protocols to reach. It operates on overlay networks, such as Tor, and provides a platform for anonymous communication and activity.

While the dark web can be used for legitimate purposes, such as maintaining privacy or bypassing censorship, it is also associated with illicit activities, including:

- Hacking forums where cybercriminals exchange tools, techniques, and information.
- Marketplaces for the sale of stolen credit cards, accounts, passwords, and other illegal goods or services.
- Coordination of malicious campaigns by threat actors.

Organizations monitor the dark web to identify threats, such as mentions of company names, executive names, or exposed proprietary data, helping to mitigate risks and protect their assets.

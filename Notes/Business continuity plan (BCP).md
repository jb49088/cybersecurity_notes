# Business continuity plan (BCP)

A business continuity plan (BCP) is a strategic framework designed to ensure that an organization can maintain critical operations or quickly resume them during and after a disruptive event. Disruptions may include natural disasters, cyberattacks, system failures, or other emergencies that impact normal business functions.

The BCP outlines procedures for maintaining essential services, safeguarding assets, and minimizing downtime. It typically includes:

- **Risk Assessment:** Identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Business Impact Analysis (BIA):** Evaluating the potential consequences of disruptions to prioritize recovery efforts.    
- **Recovery Strategies:** Developing actionable steps to restore operations, including backup systems, redundant infrastructure, and alternative workflows.
- **Communication Plan:** Establishing clear communication channels for internal teams, stakeholders, and customers during a crisis.
- **Testing and Training:** Regularly testing the plan through drills and simulations while training employees to execute it effectively.

A well-crafted BCP reduces financial losses, protects organizational reputation, and ensures regulatory compliance. It is a critical component of risk management and resilience planning.

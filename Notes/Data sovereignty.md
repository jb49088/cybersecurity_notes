# Data sovereignty

Data sovereignty refers to the concept that data stored within a particular country is subject to the laws and regulations of that country. This means that data may be subject to legal monitoring, court orders, and other governmental actions based on the jurisdiction where it resides. It creates significant implications for businesses, especially those operating internationally, as they must ensure that their data storage and processing practices comply with local laws.

In many cases, countries have laws that dictate where data can be stored, particularly when it comes to personal data or sensitive information. For instance, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires that data collected on EU citizens must be stored within the EU, or at least within jurisdictions that meet the EU's data protection standards. This creates a complex landscape where both technological solutions and legal considerations must be navigated.

The issue of data sovereignty raises questions about where data is stored, who has access to it, and how it is protected. For organizations, understanding and adhering to these compliance requirements is essential. In some instances, legal restrictions may even prevent moving data across borders, making it crucial to evaluate the implications of data sovereignty for business operations and cloud service providers.

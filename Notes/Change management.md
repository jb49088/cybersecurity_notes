[[üè∑Ô∏èRisk management]]

Change management is a structured approach to implementing modifications within an organization, ensuring changes are planned, executed, and monitored effectively to minimize risks and disruptions.

- **Purpose:** Provides guidelines for making changes, such as upgrading software, modifying firewall configurations, or adjusting switch ports, in a controlled and predictable manner.
- **Enterprise impact:** Changes occur frequently and are among the most common risks faced by organizations, often leading to issues when overlooked or improperly managed.
- **Importance of policy:** Clear policies are essential, detailing frequency, duration, installation processes, and fallback procedures to ensure smooth transitions and recovery options.
- **Challenges:** Implementing change management can be difficult, as it often requires shifting organizational culture and addressing resistance to change.
- **Consequences of neglect:** Failure to follow change management processes can result in unintended disruptions, security vulnerabilities, or system failures.

A robust change management framework is vital for maintaining system stability, reducing risk, and fostering a culture of accountability and planning.

[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

Brand impersonation involves cybercriminals pretending to be well-known brands like Coca-Cola, McDonald's, or Apple to deceive users into trusting malicious sites. Attackers create numerous impersonated websites that often appear legitimate, sometimes even making their way into search engine results or ad networks.

Once a user visits one of these sites, they are presented with pop-up messages claiming things like "You won! Special offer! Download the video!" These tactics are designed to entice users into downloading malicious content. The end result is often a malware infection, which can involve harmful pop-up ads, site tracking, or data exfiltration.

This form of attack preys on unsuspecting visitors by exploiting their trust in familiar brands. Users must be cautious of suspicious offers and always verify the authenticity of websites before interacting with them.

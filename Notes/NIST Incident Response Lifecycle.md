# NIST Incident Response Lifecycle

[[üè∑Ô∏èFramework]]

The NIST Incident Response Lifecycle, outlined in NIST Special Publication 800-61 Revision 2, provides a structured approach for organizations to effectively manage and respond to cybersecurity incidents. This lifecycle ensures that incidents are handled systematically to minimize damage, recover quickly, and learn from the event to improve future response efforts.

**The NIST Incident Response Lifecycle consists of four main phases:**

1. **Preparation:** Establish and maintain an incident response capability.
	- **Develop Policies and Procedures:** Create and maintain incident response policies, plans, and procedures.
	- **Establish an Incident Response Team:** Form and train an incident response team (IRT) with defined roles and responsibilities.
	- **Implement Tools and Resources:** Procure and deploy necessary tools, technologies, and resources to support incident detection and response.
	- **Conduct Training and Awareness:** Provide regular training and awareness programs for staff to recognize and report incidents.
	- **Develop Communication Plans:** Establish clear communication channels and protocols for internal and external reporting during an incident.

2. **Detection and Analysis:** Identify and understand the scope and impact of the incident.
	- **Monitor and Detect:** Use security monitoring tools and techniques to identify potential incidents.
	- **Analyze Data:** Collect and analyze data from logs, alerts, and other sources to determine the nature and extent of the incident.
	- **Classify Incidents:** Categorize the incident based on its severity, impact, and type.
	- **Document Findings:** Record all relevant information about the incident, including timelines, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and affected systems.

3. **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery:** Contain the incident to prevent further damage, eradicate the cause, and recover to normal operations.
	- **Containment:** Implement short-term and long-term containment strategies to limit the incident's impact.
	    - **Short-Term Containment:** Immediate actions to prevent the incident from spreading (e.g., isolating affected systems).
	    - **Long-Term Containment:** More permanent measures, such as applying patches or reconfiguring network settings.
	- **Eradication:** Identify and eliminate the root cause of the incident.
	    - **Remove Malicious Code:** Clean up infected systems and remove malware.
	    - **Identify Vulnerabilities:** Determine and mitigate vulnerabilities that were exploited.
	- **Recovery:** Restore systems to normal operations, ensuring that no residual threats remain.
	    - **Restore Systems:** Rebuild and restore affected systems from clean backups.
	    - **Monitor Systems:** Conduct additional monitoring to ensure that systems are free from compromise.

4. **Post-Incident Activity:** Review and learn from the incident to improve future response efforts and prevent recurrence.
	- **Conduct Post-Incident Analysis:** Review the incident response process, actions taken, and outcomes.
	- **Develop Lessons Learned:** Identify what worked well and what did not, documenting lessons learned.
	- **Update Policies and Procedures:** Revise and update incident response policies, plans, and procedures based on lessons learned.
	- **Conduct Training:** Provide additional training and exercises based on the findings to improve readiness.
	- **Report to Stakeholders:** Share findings and improvements with relevant stakeholders and, if necessary, regulatory bodies.

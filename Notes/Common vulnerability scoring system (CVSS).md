# Common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS)

The common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) is a standardized framework used to assess the severity of security vulnerabilities in software or systems. It provides a numerical score, ranging from 0 to 10, which helps organizations prioritize vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and exploitability.

- **Scoring system:** CVSS assigns a base score (0 to 10) based on the characteristics of the vulnerability, such as its exploitability, the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and the complexity of an attack.
- **Metrics:** CVSS uses several metrics, including the **Base**, **Temporal**, and **Environmental** scores. The base score evaluates the inherent severity, while temporal and environmental scores consider the changing factors over time and in different environments.
- **Impact assessment:** CVSS takes into account how a vulnerability could affect a system, whether it compromises confidentiality, integrity, or availability, and how easily it can be exploited.

CVSS helps security teams to evaluate and prioritize vulnerabilities for remediation, ensuring that the most critical issues are addressed first.

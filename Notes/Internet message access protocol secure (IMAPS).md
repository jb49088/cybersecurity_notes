[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork protocol]]

Internet message access protocol secure (IMAPS) is a secure version of the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), which is used for retrieving and managing email messages stored on a mail server. IMAPS adds encryption to protect the communication between email clients and servers, ensuring the privacy and integrity of email data.

- **Port number and protocol type:** IMAPS operates over port 993 using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for reliable data transfer.
- **Encryption:** IMAPS uses SSL/TLS encryption to secure the communication channel, protecting email messages from eavesdropping and ensuring data privacy during transmission.
- **Authentication:** IMAPS supports various authentication methods to verify the identities of clients and servers, helping to prevent unauthorized access to email accounts.
- **Request/response model:** IMAPS follows a request-response model, where the client sends commands to the server to retrieve or manage email messages, and the server responds with the requested data or status information.
- **IMAP vs. IMAPS:** While IMAP operates in plaintext, IMAPS adds encryption, making it a more secure option for email retrieval, particularly for sensitive or confidential messages.

IMAPS is essential for securely accessing and managing email accounts, especially in environments where data privacy and security are a top priority.

[[üè∑Ô∏èMalware]] 

A **program virus** is a type of virus that attaches itself to executable files (programs) and spreads when these files are run. It can infect a wide range of programs, including system software or user applications, and can perform various malicious actions such as corrupting data, stealing information, or installing additional malware. Program viruses are often spread through infected software downloads or infected external devices. These viruses can have significant consequences as they spread across systems and may cause the infected programs to become unusable.

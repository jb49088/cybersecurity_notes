# Crossover error rate (CER)

The crossover error rate (CER) is a performance metric used in the evaluation of biometric systems, specifically referring to the point where the false acceptance rate (FAR) and false rejection rate (FRR) are equal. In other words, CER represents the error rate at which a biometric system is equally likely to incorrectly accept an unauthorized user (false acceptance) as it is to incorrectly reject an authorized user (false rejection).

CER is an important measure when fine-tuning biometric systems to achieve a balance between security and usability. A system with a low CER generally indicates better accuracy, though it may result in a higher false rejection rate (FRR), where legitimate users are wrongly denied access. On the other hand, a system with a higher CER might experience more false acceptances (FAR), increasing the likelihood that unauthorized users gain access.

The CER is used to optimize system settings and ensure that the trade-off between FAR and FRR aligns with both security needs and user convenience. By understanding CER, organizations can adjust biometric systems to reduce errors and improve user experience, while maintaining a desired level of security. It is relevant across various types of biometric systems, including fingerprint recognition, facial recognition, iris scanning, and voice authentication.

# Topology

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetworking]]

A topology is a way of physically laying out the network. When you plan and install a network, you need to choose the right topology for your situation. Each type differs from the others by its cost, ease of installation, fault tolerance (how the topology handles problems such as cable breaks), and ease of reconfiguration (such as adding a new workstation to the existing network).

[[üè∑Ô∏èHash function]]

Message Digest 5 (MD5) is a widely used cryptographic hash function designed to produce a fixed 128-bit hash value from input data of any length. Developed by Ronald Rivest in 1991, MD5 was intended for use in digital signature applications and to verify the integrity of files and data.

MD5 operates by processing input data in 512-bit blocks through a series of mathematical transformations to generate a unique hash. While it was initially popular due to its speed and simplicity, MD5 is now considered insecure for cryptographic purposes because of vulnerabilities to collision attacks, where two different inputs produce the same hash.

Despite its weaknesses, MD5 is still used in non-security-critical applications, such as checksums for file verification. For secure hashing, modern algorithms like SHA-256 are recommended.

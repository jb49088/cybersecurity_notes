# Anonymization

Anonymization is the process of removing or modifying personal or sensitive information from data to protect individual identities while maintaining the utility of the data for analysis or other purposes. It is a key technique in data privacy and security.

- **Protects personal identities:** Removes identifiers such as names, Social Security numbers, and email addresses to prevent data from being linked back to individuals.
- **Uses data masking techniques:** Applies methods like pseudonymization, generalization, or data swapping to obscure sensitive details.
- **Supports regulatory compliance:** Helps organizations adhere to privacy laws like GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA by safeguarding personal information.
- **Maintains data utility:** Strives to balance privacy with the usability of data for analysis, research, or reporting.
- **Prevents re-identification:** Implements safeguards to ensure that anonymized data cannot be reverse-engineered to reveal personal details.

Anonymization is essential for enabling the secure use and sharing of data in scenarios where protecting privacy is a priority.

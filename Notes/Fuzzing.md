# Fuzzing

Fuzzing is a software testing technique that involves sending random, unexpected, or invalid input to an application to uncover vulnerabilities or weaknesses. This process helps identify flaws that could lead to crashes, errors, or security issues.

The process includes methods like fault injection, robustness testing, syntax testing, and negative testing. The goal is to observe the applicationâ€™s behavior when faced with abnormal input, looking for issues such as application crashes, server errors, or unhandled exceptions.

By identifying these vulnerabilities, fuzzing helps improve the stability, reliability, and security of applications.

# Policy-based access control (PBAC)

[[üè∑Ô∏èAccess control model]]

Policy-based access control (PBAC) is a security model that grants or denies access to resources based on predefined policies, rather than static roles or permissions. PBAC enables more dynamic, context-aware access control by evaluating attributes such as user identity, location, device, and risk level before granting access.

- **Centralized policy management**: Access rules are defined and managed in a policy engine rather than assigned manually.
- **Context-aware access**: Decisions consider real-time factors like device security posture, time of access, and geolocation.
- **Dynamic enforcement**: Access rights can change based on risk assessments, compliance requirements, or operational needs.

PBAC is commonly used in zero trust architectures, cloud environments, and regulatory compliance frameworks to enhance security by adapting access permissions dynamically.

# Privacy enhanced mail (PEM)

Privacy enhanced mail (PEM) is an email security standard that provides encryption, authentication, and message integrity for email communications. Originally developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), PEM was designed to enhance email privacy by using cryptographic techniques to protect messages from interception, tampering, and unauthorized access.

PEM relies on a hierarchical system of public key infrastructure (PKI) to encrypt and digitally sign email messages. It uses a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption to ensure both confidentiality and authentication. The encryption process ensures that only the intended recipient can read the message, while digital signatures verify the sender's identity and confirm that the message has not been altered in transit.

Key features of PEM:

- **Encryption:** Protects email contents from being intercepted and read by unauthorized parties.
- **Authentication:** Uses digital signatures to verify the sender's identity.
- **Message integrity:** Ensures that messages are not altered during transmission.
- **PKI-based security:** Uses a trusted certificate authority (CA) to manage encryption keys.

Although PEM introduced important email security concepts, it was not widely adopted due to its complexity and the rise of other encryption standards like Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).

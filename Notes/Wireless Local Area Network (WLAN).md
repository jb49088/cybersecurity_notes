[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork type]]

Wireless networks are everywhere today. If you use your smartphone, tablet, or laptop to look for wireless networks, chances are you will find several. A wireless local area network (WLAN) is simply a LAN, but one in which clients connect wirelessly rather than through network cables.

Wireless clients on a network typically access the network through a wireless access point (WAP). The WAP may connect wirelessly to another connectivity device, such as a wireless router, but more likely uses a wired connection to a router or switch.

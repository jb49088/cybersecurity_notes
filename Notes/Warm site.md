# Warm site

A warm site is a disaster recovery solution that offers a balance between the minimal setup of a cold site and the fully operational readiness of a hot site. It provides enough infrastructure to enable relatively quick recovery while being more cost-effective than a hot site.

A warm site typically includes essential infrastructure such as a building with utilities, rack space, and pre-installed hardware like servers and networking equipment. However, the site is not fully operational. Organizations must bring their software, applications, and data to make the systems functional. While some hardware may be pre-configured, the software and data restoration process is necessary to bring the site online.

Warm sites are often geographically dispersed to ensure resilience against regional disasters. This makes them an effective choice for organizations that require faster recovery than a cold site can provide but cannot justify the cost of maintaining a hot site.

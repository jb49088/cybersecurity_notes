# Exclusive or (XOR)

Exclusive OR (XOR) is a logical operation that outputs true or 1 only when the two input values are different. If both inputs are the same, the result is false or 0. XOR is commonly used in cryptography, error detection, and digital circuits due to its properties that provide useful functionality for various applications.

- **Binary operation:** XOR operates on binary values, performing bit-by-bit comparisons between two operands. For each bit, if the corresponding bits in both operands are different, the result is 1; if they are the same, the result is 0.
- **Properties:** XOR has several key properties that make it useful in various applications:
    - It is commutative and associative, meaning the order of operations doesn't affect the result.
    - XOR of any value with 0 results in the value itself (e.g., A ⊕ 0 = A).
    - XOR of any value with itself results in 0 (e.g., A ⊕ A = 0).
- **Cryptography:** In encryption algorithms, XOR is commonly used for combining plaintext and a key to produce ciphertext, as its reversibility allows for simple decryption by applying the same operation.
- **Error detection:** XOR is also used in error-checking algorithms like parity checks, where it helps detect discrepancies between transmitted and received data.
- **Digital circuits:** XOR gates are fundamental components in digital logic design, used in various arithmetic and logical operations within processors and other electronic systems.

XOR is a versatile and fundamental operation in both theoretical and practical applications, offering simple yet powerful functionality for data manipulation, encryption, and error correction.

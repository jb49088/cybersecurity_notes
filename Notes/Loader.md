# Loaders

[[üè∑Ô∏èMalware]] 

A loader is a type of malicious software used to deliver and execute additional malware on a compromised system. Typically, a loader works by bypassing security defenses and launching payloads like ransomware, trojans, or other forms of malware. Loaders are often part of multi-stage attacks, where they act as the initial infection vector, providing a "gateway" for further malicious software to be installed.

While loaders themselves may not be immediately destructive, they play a critical role in facilitating more damaging types of attacks, often with the goal of gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data, compromising system integrity, or enabling remote control of the infected machine.

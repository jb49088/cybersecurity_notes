[[üè∑Ô∏èAuthentication methods]]

Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication process that allows users to access multiple resources or applications with a single set of credentials, streamlining login procedures while maintaining security.

- **Single authentication for multiple resources:** Users provide their credentials once and gain access to all available or assigned resources without re-authenticating.
- **Limited time duration:** Authentication typically remains valid for a set period (e.g., 24 hours), after which re-authentication may be required.
- **Requires supporting infrastructure:** The underlying systems and applications must be configured to support SSO for seamless integration.

SSO improves user convenience and productivity by reducing the need to remember multiple passwords and re-enter login details for every application.

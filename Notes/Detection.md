# Detection

Detection is the process of identifying potential security incidents or threats based on various methods or techniques. It plays a crucial role in cybersecurity by alerting organizations to suspicious activities that may compromise their systems or data.

- **True Positive:** Instances where the detection system correctly identifies a threat as being a threat.
- **False Positive:** Instances where the detection system incorrectly identifies a non-threat as being a threat (false alarm).
- **True Negative:** Instances where the detection system correctly identifies a non-threat as not being a threat.
- **False Negative:** Instances where the detection system incorrectly identifies a threat as not being a threat (missed detection).

## Detection methods

### Anomaly detection

Anomaly detection is a method used to identify deviations from normal behavior or patterns within systems or networks, which may indicate potential threats or incidents.

- **Requires baseline definition:** Anomaly-based analysis depends on establishing a clear [[Security baselines|baseline image]] of normal behavior for the system or network. This baseline is built by monitoring activity over a period of time.

- **Detects novel threats:** Anomaly-based analysis can be effective in detecting [[Exploits#Zero-day exploits|zero-day exploits]]. This is because it doesn't rely on predefined attack [[Analysis#Signature|signatures]].

- **Complementary approach:** Anomaly-based analysis is often combined with signature analysis for a more comprehensive security posture. This layered approach helps to identify both known and unknown threats.

- **Continuous monitoring:** The baseline needs to be continuously updated as user behavior and network traffic patterns evolve over time.

- **False positives:** This approach can also generate a higher number of false positives. Finding the right balance between the accuracy and sensitivity is crucial.

### Signature-based detection

Signature-based detection is a method used to identify known patterns or signatures of malicious activities within systems or networks, facilitating the detection of specific threats based on predefined characteristics.

	- 

### Heuristic detection

Heuristic detection is a method used in cybersecurity to identify potentially malicious or abnormal behaviors based on general rules or algorithms, rather than specific patterns or signatures.

- **General rules and algorithms:** Heuristic detection uses general rules, algorithms, or models to identify behaviors that may indicate a threat, without relying on specific signatures or known patterns.
	- 
- **Identifies unknown threats:** It is effective in detecting previously unknown or emerging threats that do not match known signatures or behaviors.
	- 
- **Behavior-based analysis:** Heuristic detection analyzes behaviors such as file access patterns, system activities, or network traffic to detect anomalies that may suggest malicious intent.
	- 
- **Adaptive approach:** It adapts over time by refining its rules and algorithms based on new data and evolving threat landscapes.
	- 
- **Potential for false positives:** Heuristic detection may generate false positives if legitimate activities resemble malicious behaviors or if the heuristic rules are not finely tuned.
	- 
- **Complementary to other methods:** It is often used alongside signature-based detection and behavioral analysis to provide a layered approach to cybersecurity, enhancing overall threat detection capabilities.
	- 

### Machine Learning-based detection

Machine learning-based detection is a method used in cybersecurity to identify patterns, anomalies, or behaviors indicative of potential threats or security incidents, leveraging advanced algorithms and models.

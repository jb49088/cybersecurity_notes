# Real-time operating system (RTOS)

A Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) is designed to process data with strict timing constraints, ensuring deterministic and predictable execution of tasks. RTOS is commonly used in applications where timing and reliability are critical, such as industrial machinery, automotive systems, and military environments.

Key characteristics of an RTOS:

- **Deterministic Scheduling:** Prioritizes tasks to meet stringent timing requirements, with no tolerance for delays.
- **High Availability:** Must operate without interruption, making reliability a fundamental requirement.
- **Specialized Applications:** Frequently deployed in embedded systems where consistent performance is vital.

Security considerations for RTOS are especially challenging due to its complexity and need for continuous availability. Systems often operate in sensitive environments, making robust security measures essential to prevent disruptions.

# Network attached storage (NAS)

Network attached storage (NAS) is a specialized file storage solution connected to a network, providing centralized data access to multiple users and devices. NAS allows for efficient file sharing, backup, and storage management across an organization or home network.

A NAS device typically includes one or more hard drives configured to work together, offering features such as data redundancy, scalability, and remote access. It is designed to simplify storage management by consolidating data into one accessible location, making it easier for users to share files, collaborate, and perform data backups.

- **Centralized storage:** Provides a central location for storing and accessing files, reducing the need for local storage on individual devices.
- **File sharing:** Enables multiple users to access and share files simultaneously over the network, with permissions and security controls to protect data.
- **Data redundancy:** Often includes features like RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) to ensure data protection against hardware failures.
- **Remote access:** Many NAS solutions offer cloud-based access or VPN integration, allowing users to access their data from anywhere.
- **Scalability:** NAS systems are designed to grow with an organizationâ€™s needs by easily adding additional drives or storage units.

NAS is commonly used in businesses for file sharing and backup, but it is also useful in home environments for storing and streaming media, managing personal data, and performing automated backups.

[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

Dumpster diving refers to the practice of searching through commercial or residential trash to find discarded items, often for the purpose of obtaining personal or sensitive information. In the context of security, dumpster diving is a tactic used by attackers to gather confidential data, such as financial records, account details, or even passwords, that have been improperly discarded.

This technique relies on the assumption that valuable information may be found in documents or electronic devices thrown away without being properly shredded or destroyed. To prevent dumpster diving attacks, it's crucial to securely dispose of sensitive materials, such as by shredding paper documents and wiping data from electronic devices before disposal.

# Digital Signature Standard (DSS)

Digital Signature Standard (DSS) is a federal standard for digital signatures established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1994. It defines the approved methods for generating and verifying digital signatures to ensure the authenticity and integrity of electronic documents and communications.

DSS specifies three algorithms for digital signatures:

- **Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA):** The original algorithm in DSS, designed specifically for creating digital signatures.
  <br>
- **RSA:** Later added to the standard for compatibility with broader cryptographic systems.
  <br>
- **Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA):** A more efficient algorithm for environments with limited resources, based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).

DSS is widely used in secure communications, ensuring that messages are both genuine and untampered. It is commonly implemented in protocols like SSL/TLS and secure email systems.

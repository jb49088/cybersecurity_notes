# Embedded systems

Embedded systems are specialized hardware and software configurations designed to perform specific tasks, often as part of a larger system. Unlike general-purpose computing devices, embedded systems are optimized for dedicated functions, emphasizing efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

Key characteristics of embedded systems:

- **Specific Functionality:** Built for a singular purpose, allowing for focused optimization.
- **Integration:** Often integrated into larger systems, enabling seamless operation.
- **Optimization:** Prioritized for size, power consumption, and cost, depending on the application.

These systems are integral to modern technology, offering precise and efficient functionality tailored to their specific roles.

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetworking]]

The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of physical devices, vehicles, appliances, and other objects embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity, enabling them to collect, exchange, and interact with data over the internet. These devices can communicate with each other and central systems to automate processes, enhance operational efficiency, and improve user experiences.

IoT applications span multiple industries, including smart homes, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. In smart homes, devices like thermostats, lights, and security systems can be controlled remotely. In healthcare, wearables monitor vital signs in real-time. IoT also plays a significant role in industrial settings, where machines and sensors can detect faults, optimize performance, and improve safety.

The widespread adoption of IoT brings numerous benefits, including greater efficiency and convenience, but it also raises concerns about data privacy, security, and the management of interconnected devices.

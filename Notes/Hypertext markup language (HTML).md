[[üè∑Ô∏èDevelopment]]

Hypertext markup language (HTML) is the standard language used to create and design documents on the web. HTML defines the structure and layout of a web page by using a set of tags and attributes to organize content such as text, images, links, and multimedia elements.

- **Document structure:** HTML provides a framework to structure content, including headers, paragraphs, lists, and tables. It enables browsers to render the content in a readable format.
- **Tags and elements:** HTML uses tags, such as `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<img>`, to define elements within a document. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, and the structure is usually nested to organize content hierarchically.
- **Links and navigation:** HTML allows the creation of hyperlinks using the `<a>` tag, which enables users to navigate between web pages, documents, or external resources.
- **Multimedia support:** HTML supports the embedding of images, audio, video, and other multimedia elements, enabling interactive and engaging web pages.
- **Compatibility:** HTML is supported by all modern web browsers, ensuring that content can be viewed across different platforms and devices.

HTML is the foundation of web development and is essential for building the structure of web pages. It works in tandem with other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create functional, styled, and interactive websites.

# Software update

Software updates are essential for keeping your operating system and applications secure. They often contain bug fixes and critical security patches that protect against vulnerabilities. Failing to update your software can expose your system to exploits and malware.

However, updates come with their own risks. Not all updates are secure, and attackers may exploit the update process. For example, the 2020 SolarWinds Orion attack saw malicious code inserted into software updates, affecting hundreds of organizations, including government agencies.

Best practices for software updates:

- Always back up your data before updating.
- Install updates from trusted sources.
- Ensure your backup is current and reliable.

Automatic updates simplify this process by allowing apps to update themselves. These updates often include security checks and digital signatures, ensuring authenticity. While automatic updates are generally trustworthy, itâ€™s still important to install updates from trusted sources and maintain a backup before proceeding.

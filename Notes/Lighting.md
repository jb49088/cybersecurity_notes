[[üè∑Ô∏èPhysical security]]

Lighting is an essential physical security control used to deter unauthorized access, enhance visibility, and support surveillance efforts in and around secured areas. Properly designed and implemented lighting increases the likelihood of detecting suspicious activities and reduces the chances of successful intrusions by creating a sense of exposure for potential attackers.

Effective security lighting illuminates vulnerable areas such as building entrances, parking lots, fences, and pathways, ensuring that security personnel and surveillance systems can monitor activity clearly. Types of lighting used in security applications include floodlights for wide coverage, motion-activated lights for energy efficiency and alerting, and continuous lighting for critical perimeters.

In addition to deterring criminal behavior, well-placed lighting improves safety by reducing accidents in poorly lit areas and guiding authorized personnel. Security lighting is often integrated with other systems, such as cameras and motion sensors, to provide layered protection. To ensure optimal performance, lighting systems should be regularly maintained and designed to minimize shadows and blind spots that could be exploited.

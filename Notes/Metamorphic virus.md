[[üè∑Ô∏èMalware]] 

A **metamorphic virus** is a type of virus that can completely rewrite its own code every time it infects a new system, making it appear different from its previous versions. Unlike polymorphic viruses, which only alter their appearance while maintaining the same core structure, metamorphic viruses change their entire structure, making detection and analysis extremely difficult. This allows the virus to avoid signature-based detection methods used by antivirus software. Metamorphic viruses are typically used in sophisticated and targeted attacks, where the goal is to remain undetected for as long as possible.

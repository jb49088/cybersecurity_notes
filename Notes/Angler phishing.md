[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

Angler phishing is a form of social engineering in which attackers impersonate legitimate entities to deceive users into divulging sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, or financial data. Unlike traditional phishing, Angler Phishing specifically targets individuals through social media platforms, often using fake accounts or impersonating official customer service representatives to engage victims.

# Geofencing

Geofencing is a location-based security technique that creates a virtual boundary around a specific geographic area, either defined by GPS, RFID, Wi-Fi, or cellular data. When a device enters or exits this defined area, it triggers a predefined action or alert. Geofencing is commonly used in cybersecurity for location-based access control, ensuring that certain data or applications are only accessible within a secure geographic region. This can help protect sensitive information, monitor device movements, and enforce security policies based on a user's location.

Geofencing can be applied in various contexts, including mobile device management (MDM), data loss prevention (DLP), and location-based services. For example, a company might use geofencing to restrict access to confidential data when employees are outside of designated office areas.

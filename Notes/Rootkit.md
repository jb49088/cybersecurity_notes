[[🏷️Malware]] 

A rootkit is a type of malware designed to gain unauthorized access to a system and maintain privileged control over it, often without the user's knowledge. It operates by hiding its presence, making it difficult to detect and remove. Rootkits can manipulate system processes, files, or even hardware to evade security measures, often enabling cybercriminals to execute other malicious activities like data theft or remote control.

# Web application

A web application is a software program that runs on a web server rather than being installed on a local computer. Accessible through a web browser, web applications allow users to interact with the software over the internet. They are designed to be platform-independent, meaning they can be used on various devices and operating systems as long as there is a browser and an internet connection.

Web applications are widely used for a variety of purposes, including online banking, social media, e-commerce, email, and productivity tools like document editing and project management. Unlike traditional desktop applications, web apps are typically easier to maintain and update since changes are made on the server side and don't require users to install updates manually.

Web applications rely on technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side programming languages (e.g., Python, PHP, Ruby) to function. Security is a critical consideration for web apps, as they are often targets for cyberattacks. Measures like encryption, secure coding practices, and regular security audits are essential to protect user data and ensure the integrity of the application.

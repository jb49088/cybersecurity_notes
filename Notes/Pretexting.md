[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

Pretexting is a form of social engineering where an attacker creates a fabricated scenario or pretext to manipulate a victim into revealing confidential information. This tactic often involves impersonating someone the target knows or trusts, such as a colleague, bank representative, or government official. Pretexting is used to gain access to sensitive data like personal identification numbers (PINs), account details, or login credentials.

Unlike phishing, which typically relies on generic and mass-targeted messages, pretexting is often more targeted, as the attacker customizes the story to suit the victim's background and situation. The goal is to build trust with the victim, making them more likely to disclose sensitive information or take actions that benefit the attacker.

# Cloud responsibility matrix

The cloud responsibility matrix defines the allocation of security and management responsibilities between cloud service providers (CSPs) and their customers. The division of responsibilities depends on the cloud service model being used: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Software as a Service (SaaS). This matrix ensures clarity and accountability for securing the cloud environment.

In IaaS, customers handle most responsibilities, including securing applications, data, and operating systems, while the provider manages the physical infrastructure. PaaS shifts some responsibilities to the provider, with customers focusing on application and data security. SaaS minimizes customer responsibility, with the provider securing the application, platform, and infrastructure, leaving customers to manage data and user access.

Responsibilities can vary based on the cloud provider, service agreements, and compliance requirements. Most CSPs provide detailed matrices to document these roles, ensuring all parties understand their obligations and reducing the risk of security oversights.

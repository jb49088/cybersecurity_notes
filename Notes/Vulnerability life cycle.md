# Vulnerability life cycle

Now that you've learned about many of the activities involved in vulnerability management, let's take a look at the entire vulnerability life cycle and how these pieces fit together, 

## Vulnerability Identification

During the first stage in the process, the organization becomes aware of a vulnerability that exists within their environment. This identification may come from many different sources, including:

- Vulnerability scans run by the organization or outside assessors
- Penetration tests of the organization's environment
- Reports from responsible disclosure or bug bounty programs
- Results of system and process audits

## Vulnerability Analysis

After identifying a possible vulnerability in the organization's environment, cybersecurity professionals next perform an analysis of that report. This includes several core tasks:

- Confirming that the vulnerability exists and is not the result of a false positive report 
- Prioritizing and categorizing the vulnerability using tools such as CVSS and CVE that provide an external assessment of the vulnerability 
- Supplementing the external analysis of the vulnerability with organization specific details, such as the organization's exposure factor to the vulnerability, environmental variables, industry and organizational impact, and the organization's risk tolerance

## Vulnerability Response and Remediation

The outcome of the vulnerability analysis should guide the organization to identify the vulnerabilities that are most in need of remediation. At this point, cybersecurity professionals should respond to the vulnerability in one or more of the following ways:

- Apply a patch or other corrective measure to correct the vulnerability. 
- Use network segmentation to isolate the affected system so that the probability of an exploit becomes remote. 
- Implement other compensating controls, such as application firewalls or intrusion prevention systems, to reduce the likelihood that an attempted exploit will be successful. 
- Purchase insurance to transfer the financial risk of the vulnerability to an insurance provider.
- Grant an exception or exemption to the system as part of a formal risk acceptance strategy.

## Validation of Remediation

After completing a vulnerability remediation effort, cybersecurity professionals should perform a validation that the vulnerability is no longer present. This is typically done by rescanning the affected system and verifying that the vulnerability no longer appears in scan results. In the case of more serious vulnerabilities, internal or external auditors may perform this validation to provide independent assurance that the issue is resolved.

## Reporting 

The final stage in the vulnerability life cycle is reporting, which involves communicating the findings, actions taken, and lessons learned to relevant stakeholders within the organization. This step ensures that decision-makers are informed about the current state of the organization's security posture and the effectiveness of the vulnerability management program. Reporting may include:

- Summarizing the vulnerabilities identified, analyzed, and remediated, along with their initial severity and impact on the organization
- Providing details on the remediation actions taken, including patches applied, compensating controls implemented, and risk acceptance decisions made 
- Highlighting any trends, patterns, or areas requiring further attention, such as recurring vulnerabilities or systems that are particularly susceptible to exploitation 
- Offering recommendations for improvements in the vulnerability management process, security policies, or employee training programs based on the findings and experiences throughout the life cycle

Regular and comprehensive reporting not only demonstrates the organization's commitment to cybersecurity but also enables continuous improvement by identifying potential gaps in the vulnerability management process and fostering a proactive approach to addressing security risks.

## Summary

Security assessment and testing plays a crucial role in the ongoing management of a cybersecurity program. The techniques discussed in this chapter help cybersecurity professionals maintain effective security controls and stay abreast of changes in their environment that might alter their security posture.

Vulnerability scanning identifies potential security issues in systems, applications, and devices, providing teams with the ability to remediate those issues before they are exploited by attackers. The vulnerabilities that may be detected during these scans include improper patch management, weak configurations, default accounts, and the use of insecure protocols and ciphers.

Penetration testing puts security professionals in the role of attackers and asks them to conduct offensive operations against their targets in an effort to discover security issues. The results of penetration tests provide a roadmap for improving security controls.

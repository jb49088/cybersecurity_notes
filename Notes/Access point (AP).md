# Access point (AP)

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetworking device]]

Access points are crucial components in wireless networking. They serve as a bridge between wired networks and wireless devices, allowing devices like laptops, smartphones, and tablets to connect to a network without physical cables.

## Key Functions of Access Points:

1. **Wireless Connectivity:** APs transmit and receive data wirelessly, enabling devices to access network resources without being tethered to a specific location.
2. **Network Extension:** They can extend the coverage of an existing network, allowing users to connect in areas where the wired network may not reach.
3. **Signal Management:** APs can manage multiple connections simultaneously, optimizing traffic to ensure reliable performance across many devices.
4. **Security:** They typically support various security protocols (like [[Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2)|WPA2]], [[Wi-Fi Protected Access III (WPA3)|WPA3]]) to protect data transmitted over the network.
5. **Network Control:** In larger networks, APs can be managed centrally (often through a controller), allowing for easier configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

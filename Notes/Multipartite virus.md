# Multipartite virus

[[🏷️Malware]] 

A multipartite virus is a type of virus that can infect a system through multiple vectors or methods. It may use a combination of approaches, such as infecting the boot sector, attaching itself to executable files, or exploiting vulnerabilities in software. Multipartite viruses are more versatile and resilient compared to other viruses, as they can continue to spread even if one method of infection is detected and removed. These viruses are particularly dangerous because they can cause a variety of system issues, making them difficult to clean and remove.

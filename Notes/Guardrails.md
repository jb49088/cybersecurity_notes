# Guardrails

Guardrails refer to predefined boundaries or constraints designed to keep actions, processes, or systems within safe and acceptable limits. In the context of cybersecurity, IT infrastructure, or even business operations, guardrails are implemented to reduce risk, prevent mistakes, and ensure compliance by providing automated or manual oversight.

- **Preventative controls**: Guardrails help prevent errors or unsafe actions by automatically blocking or alerting when users or systems attempt to exceed limits or engage in risky behavior.
- **Automated enforcement**: Many modern guardrails are integrated into systems to automatically enforce policies, such as preventing unauthorized access, ensuring compliance with regulations, or managing resources effectively.
- **Configuration management**: In cloud environments, guardrails often refer to configurations that restrict the use of certain resources, settings, or services that don't meet security or compliance standards.
- **Monitoring and alerting**: Guardrails are frequently used in combination with monitoring tools to track deviations and generate alerts for manual intervention when automatic prevention isn't sufficient.
- **Flexibility and scalability**: While guardrails are designed to prevent unwanted actions, they should be flexible enough to allow for innovation and growth, especially in agile or rapidly changing environments.

Implementing effective guardrails ensures that systems and operations stay within defined parameters, reducing the risk of costly errors or security breaches while enabling safe growth and flexibility.

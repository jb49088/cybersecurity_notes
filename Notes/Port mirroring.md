# Port mirroring

Port mirroring is a technique used in networking to copy network traffic from one port or multiple ports on a network switch to another port for monitoring or analysis. This allows network administrators to observe the traffic passing through specific parts of the network without disrupting normal operations.

- **Traffic analysis**: By mirroring the traffic, network administrators can capture and inspect the data packets for troubleshooting, performance analysis, and security monitoring.
- **Network troubleshooting**: Helps identify network issues such as congestion, connectivity problems, or configuration errors by allowing a detailed inspection of network traffic.
- **Security monitoring**: Port mirroring enables the use of intrusion detection systems (IDS) and other security tools to monitor traffic for suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.

Port mirroring is commonly used in environments where there is a need for continuous monitoring, such as in data centers or enterprise networks. It is typically configured on network switches to duplicate traffic to a specific port connected to a network analyzer or monitoring tool.

Content filtering is a security process used to regulate and monitor the flow of data, ensuring compliance with policies and protecting users from inappropriate or malicious content.

- **Traffic Control Based on Content**: Filters network traffic by examining the data within it, using methods such as URL filtering and website category filtering to determine accessibility.
- **Corporate Data Oversight**: Helps organizations manage the flow of sensitive materials in both inbound and outbound traffic, ensuring data protection and compliance.
- **Inappropriate Content Control**: Prevents access to unsuitable material, including not-safe-for-work content and those restricted by parental controls.
- **Threat Protection**: Enhances security with integrated anti-virus and anti-malware solutions to guard against malicious threats.

Content filtering plays a vital role in maintaining a secure, policy-compliant network environment while protecting users from harmful or inappropriate content.

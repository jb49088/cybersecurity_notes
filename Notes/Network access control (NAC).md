# Network access control (NAC)

Network access control (NAC) is a security solution that enforces policies for device access to a network. It helps ensure that only authorized and compliant devices can connect to the network, enhancing security by preventing unauthorized access.

- **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of devices or users attempting to access the network.
- **Authorization:** Ensures devices comply with security policies (e.g., antivirus, software versions) before granting access.
- **Quarantine:** Devices that donâ€™t meet security standards are placed in a restricted area with limited access.
- **Monitoring:** Continuously monitors devices connected to the network for suspicious activity.

NAC helps protect network resources by limiting exposure to threats and ensuring that devices meet security requirements before they can connect. It plays a crucial role in controlling access, reducing security risks, and ensuring compliance with internal and regulatory standards.

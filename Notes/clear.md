# clear

[[🏷️Linux command]]

The `clear` command in Linux clears the terminal screen. It removes all the text and output currently displayed on the terminal and gives you a clean slate to work with.

Here is an example of how to use the `clear` command:

`clear`

This will clear the terminal screen and move the cursor to the top-left corner of the screen.

You can also use the `clear` command in combination with other commands, like this:

`ls -l; clear`

This will list the files and directories in the current directory, and then clear the terminal screen.

> [!note]
> The clear command does not delete any files or data from your system. It only affects the display of the terminal

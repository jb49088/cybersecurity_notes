[[üè∑Ô∏èAuthentication methods]]

Biometric factors are an example of the ‚Äúsomething you are‚Äù factor, and they rely on the unique physiology of the user to validate their identity. Some biometric technologies also count as one of the factors that the Security+ exam outline describes, because they are something you are, like a voice print or gait. Some of the most common biometric technologies include the following:

- Fingerprints, which check the unique patterns of ridges and valleys on your fingertips using either optical, ultrasonic, or capacitive scanners. Fingerprint scanning has been broadly deployed within both Windows, using fingerprint scanners on laptops, and Android and Apple devices that use fingerprint readers.
- Retina scanning uses the unique patterns of blood vessels in the retina to tell users apart. 
- Iris recognition systems use pattern recognition and infrared imaging to uniquely identify an individual's eyes. Iris recognition can be accomplished from farther away than retina scans, making it preferable in many circumstances.
- Facial recognition techniques match specific features to an original image in a database. Facial recognition is widely used in Apple iPhone for Face ID, making it a broadly deployed biometric technology.
- Voice recognition systems rely on patterns, rhythms, and the sounds of a user's voice itself to recognize the user. 
- Vein recognition, sometimes called vein matching or vascular technology, uses scanners that can see the pattern of veins, often in a user's finger or arm. Vein scanners do not need to touch the user, unlike fingerprint scanners, making them less likely to be influenced by things like dirt or skin conditions. 
- Gait analysis measures how a person walks to identify them.

Biometric technologies are assessed based on four major measures. The first is Type I errors, or the false rejection rate (FRR). False rejection errors mean that a legitimate biometric measure was presented and the system rejected it. Type II errors, or false acceptance errors, are measured as the false acceptance rate (FAR). These occur when a biometric factor is presented and is accepted when it shouldn't be. These are compared using a measure called the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The ROC compares the FRR against the FAR of a system, typically as a graph. For most systems, as you decrease the likelihood of false rejection, you will increase the rate of false acceptance, and determining where the accuracy of a system should be set to minimize false acceptance and prevent false rejection is an important element in the configuration of biometric systems.

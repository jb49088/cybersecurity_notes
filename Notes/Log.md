# Log

Logs provide a critical record of system activity and are essential for monitoring, troubleshooting, and securing IT environments. Different types of logs offer insights into various aspects of network and system operations.

- **Firewall logs:** Record traffic details such as source/destination IP, port numbers, and traffic disposition. Next-generation firewalls (NGFW) include logs for applications, URL filtering categories, and suspicious data.
- **Application logs:** Contain data specific to applications. Examples include Windows Event Viewer, Linux/macOS `/var/log`, and parsing tools like a Security Information and Event Manager (SIEM) for filtering and analysis.
- **Endpoint logs:** Track activity on endpoints like phones, laptops, and servers. Logs capture events such as logons, policy changes, processes, and account management. These logs are often aggregated in a SIEM for correlation with security events.
- **OS-specific security logs:** Focus on operating system-level security events such as authentication attempts, brute force attacks, and file changes. Proper filtering helps prioritize relevant data.
- **IPS/IDS logs:** Intrusion prevention and detection system logs provide details about known vulnerabilities, attack types, timestamps, and source/destination IPs and ports. These systems are often integrated into NGFWs.
- **Network logs:** Generated by switches, routers, VPN concentrators, and other network devices. They highlight network changes, routing updates, authentication issues, and security concerns.

Comprehensive logging is vital for proactive threat detection, forensic investigations, and maintaining secure and reliable operations.

# Single loss expectancy (SLE)

Single loss expectancy (SLE) is a metric used in risk management to estimate the potential financial loss associated with a single occurrence of a specific risk or threat. SLE helps organizations assess the cost of an incident should it happen, providing a basis for calculating broader financial impacts like the Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE).

The SLE is calculated by determining the **cost** of a single loss event, which could include factors like repair costs, recovery costs, lost revenue, and other related expenses. The formula for calculating SLE is:

**SLE = Asset Value Ã— Exposure Factor**

- **Asset Value** refers to the monetary value of the asset at risk.
- **Exposure Factor** is the percentage of the asset's value that would be lost in the event of a risk occurring.

Understanding SLE is essential for organizations to assess the financial impact of specific threats and determine the appropriate security measures to mitigate those risks. When combined with the **Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO)**, the SLE helps organizations calculate the **Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE)**, which provides a clear financial estimate of the potential losses from a given risk over the course of a year.

# Cyber threat intelligence (CTI)

Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is the process of collecting, analyzing, and applying information about cyber threats to improve security decision-making. CTI helps organizations anticipate, detect, and respond to threats more effectively by understanding attacker tactics, motives, and capabilities.

- **Threat identification:** Gathers intelligence on threat actors, malware, vulnerabilities, and attack patterns.
- **Proactive defense:** Enables organizations to anticipate threats and implement protective measures before an attack occurs.
- **Strategic, operational, tactical intelligence:** CTI is categorized into different levels, from high-level strategic insights to detailed technical indicators.
- **Indicators of compromise (IOCs):** Provides data on malicious activities such as IP addresses, domains, or file hashes used by attackers.
- **Integration with security tools:** Enhances SIEMs, firewalls, and endpoint security solutions with actionable intelligence.

CTI strengthens an organizationâ€™s security posture by providing real-time insights into emerging threats, helping to mitigate risks before they cause harm.

# Containerization

Containerization is a technology that packages an application and its dependencies into a single, standardized unit of software called a container. This self-contained environment ensures the application can run consistently across various computing environments, from development to production.

Containers operate as isolated processes in a sandbox, preventing interactions between applications and ensuring security. Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host operating systemâ€™s kernel, making them lightweight and highly efficient. The use of container images standardizes portability, allowing developers to deploy applications seamlessly across different platforms.

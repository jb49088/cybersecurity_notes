# On-path browser attack

[[üè∑Ô∏èWeb application attack]]

An on-path browser attack, previously known as a man-in-the-browser (MitB) attack, occurs when malware or a trojan on the victim's device intercepts and manipulates web traffic directly within the browser. Unlike traditional on-path attacks, the attacker operates entirely within the victim's system, making detection even harder.

This method allows attackers to proxy encrypted traffic seamlessly, as the malicious software has access to data before encryption or after decryption. To the victim, everything appears normal, while the attacker can steal sensitive information or inject malicious actions, such as transferring money from a banking session.

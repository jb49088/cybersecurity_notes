[[üè∑Ô∏èMalware]] 

Scareware is a type of malicious software designed to deceive users into thinking their computer is infected with a virus or other critical problem, often through alarming pop-ups or fake system alerts. The goal of scareware is to scare users into purchasing fake security software or providing personal information by exploiting their fear of a non-existent issue.

Scareware typically involves tactics such as:

- **Fake virus alerts:** Warning users that their system is infected and prompting them to download or purchase fake security tools.
  <br>
- **Deceptive pop-ups:** Displaying urgent, false notifications to create a sense of panic.
  <br>
- **Disruptive system behavior:** Making changes to system settings or creating slowdowns to make the user feel their device is compromised.

While scareware isn't usually destructive like other types of malware, it can lead to financial loss, identity theft, or the installation of additional malicious software.

# Gap analysis

Gap analysis is a process used to identify the difference between an organization’s current security posture and its desired state. It highlights areas that need improvement to meet security goals, industry standards, or compliance requirements.

## Key steps:

- **Assess Current State:** Review existing security measures, policies, and technologies.
- **Define Desired State:** Set goals based on compliance standards or industry best practices.
- **Identify Gaps:** Pinpoint areas where the current state doesn’t align with the desired state.
- **Create Action Plan:** Develop steps to address the gaps, such as improving policies, upgrading technology, or ensuring compliance.
- **Implement Solutions:** Execute the action plan and monitor progress.

Gap analysis improves security by identifying weaknesses, ensures compliance with regulations, and helps prioritize resources for critical improvements.

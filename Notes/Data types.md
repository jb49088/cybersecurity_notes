Data comes in various types, each with unique characteristics and security requirements. Understanding these types is essential for effective protection.

- **Regulated data:** Refers to information governed by legal or regulatory frameworks, such as personal data covered by GDPR or healthcare data protected by HIPAA. It must be handled according to strict compliance standards to avoid legal penalties.
- **Trade secrets:** Confidential business information, such as manufacturing processes, formulas, or customer lists, that give companies a competitive edge. Protecting trade secrets is crucial for maintaining business advantage and preventing corporate espionage.
- **Intellectual property:** Includes creations of the mind, like patents, trademarks, and copyrights. It represents innovative products or ideas that are legally protected to ensure ownership rights and prevent unauthorized use or duplication by others.
- **Legal information:** Refers to data related to legal matters, including contracts, case files, and court rulings. It must be securely stored and accessed to maintain privacy, protect rights, and comply with legal procedures and regulations.
- **Financial information:** Includes data about an organizationâ€™s financial activities, such as balance sheets, transactions, and tax records. This sensitive data must be safeguarded against fraud, theft, and regulatory violations through encryption and access controls.
- **Human-readable vs non-human readable data:** Human-readable data is information formatted for easy understanding, such as text documents or spreadsheets. **Non-human readable data**, like encrypted or binary data, requires specific tools or permissions to be interpreted, ensuring enhanced security during storage or transmission.

# CVSS Metrics

CVSS metrics are designed to evaluate and quantify the severity of vulnerabilities. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key metrics

## Attack Vector Metric (AV)

The attack vector metric (AV) describes how an attacker would exploit the vulnerability and is assigned according to the criteria shown in Table 1.12.

![[Table 1.12]]

## Attack Complexity Metric (AC)

The attack complexity metric (AC) describes the difficulty of exploiting the vulnerability and is assigned according to the criteria shown in Table 1.13

![[Table 1.13]]

## Privileges Required Metric (PR)

The privileges required metric (PR) describes the type of account access that an attacker would need to exploit a vulnerability and is assigned according to the criteria in Table 1.14.

![[Table 1.14]]

## User Interaction Metric (UI)

The user interaction metric (UI) describes whether the attacker needs to involve another human in the attack. The user interaction metric is assigned according to the criteria in Table 1.15.

## Confidentiality Metric (C)

The confidentiality metric (C) describes the type of information disclosure that might occur if an attacker successfully exploits the vulnerability. The confidentiality metric is assigned according to the criteria in Table 1.16.

## Integrity Metric (I)

The integrity metric (I) describes the type of information alteration that might occur if an attacker successfully exploits the vulnerability. The integrity metric is assigned according to the criteria in Table 1.17.

![[Table 1.17]]

## Availability Metric (A)

The availability metric (A) describes the type of disruption that might occur if an attacker successfully exploits the vulnerability. The availability metric is assigned according to the criteria in Table 1.18.

![[Table 1.18]]

## Scope Metric (S)

The scope metric (S) describes whether the vulnerability can affect system components beyond the scope of the vulnerability. The scope metric is assigned according to the criteria in Table 5.8. Note that the scope metric table does not contain score information. The value of the scope metric is reflected in the values for the privileges required metric, shown earlier in Table 1.19.

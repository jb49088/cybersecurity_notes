# Dependencies

Dependencies in cybersecurity and IT refer to systems, applications, or services that other components rely on for functionality. Understanding dependencies is crucial for risk management and system resilience.

Key considerations:

- **Mapping Dependencies:** Identifying interconnections between systems.
- **Risk Assessment:** Evaluating the impact of dependency failures.
- **Updates and Patches:** Ensuring dependent components are up to date.

Proper dependency management enhances system reliability and minimizes vulnerabilities.

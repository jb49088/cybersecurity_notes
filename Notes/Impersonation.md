[[üè∑Ô∏èSocial engineering]]

Impersonation is a form of social engineering where attackers pretend to be someone else‚Äîsuch as a trusted individual, a company, or a government entity‚Äîto deceive people into providing sensitive information or performing actions that benefit the attacker. The goal of impersonation is often to gain unauthorized access to accounts, steal financial assets, or gather confidential information by exploiting trust and authority.

Impersonation attacks can take many forms, including fake emails, phone calls, or social media messages that appear to come from a legitimate source. These attacks rely on mimicking the communication style, tone, and branding of the real entity to trick victims into believing they are interacting with someone they know or trust.

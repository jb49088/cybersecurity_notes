# NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)

[[üè∑Ô∏èFramework]]

The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) provides a structured process for organizations to manage security and privacy risks associated with their information systems. Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), RMF integrates security, privacy, and risk management activities into the system development lifecycle. It helps organizations comply with federal information security regulations and manage risks in a cost-effective and efficient manner.

The RMF consists of seven steps that guide organizations through the risk management process

1. **Prepare:** Lay the groundwork for the risk management process.
    - Establish a context for the organization‚Äôs risk management activities.
    - Identify and engage stakeholders.
    - Determine organizational risk tolerance.
    - Implement an organization-wide risk management strategy.
    - Conduct risk assessments and develop risk profiles.

2. **Categorize:** Determine the criticality and sensitivity of the information system and the data processed.
    - Categorize the information system and information based on potential impact.
    - Document the categorization results in the system security plan.
    - Review and approve the categorization decision.

3. **Select:** Select appropriate security controls to protect the information system.
    - Identify baseline security controls based on the system categorization.
    - Tailor and supplement the controls as needed to address specific risks.
    - Document the selected controls in the system security plan.
    - Develop a strategy for continuous monitoring of security controls.

4. **Implement:** Implement the selected security controls in the information system.
    - Apply the security controls within the system and its environment.
    - Document the implementation details in the system security plan.
    - Develop operational procedures for the security controls.

5. **Assess:** Determine if the implemented security controls are effective.
    - Develop a security assessment plan.
    - Conduct the security assessment using appropriate methods.
    - Document the assessment findings in a security assessment report.
    - Address any deficiencies and reassess if necessary.

6. **Authorize:** Ensure the information system is authorized to operate based on the assessed risk.
    - Prepare the authorization package, including the system security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones.
    - Conduct a risk assessment to determine the risk to organizational operations and assets.
    - Make an authorization decision and document it in an authorization decision document.

7. Monitor: Continuously monitor the security controls and the system environment.
    - Implement a continuous monitoring strategy.
    - Conduct ongoing assessments of security controls.
    - Track and document changes to the information system.
    - Respond to incidents and vulnerabilities.
    - Report security status to organizational leaders.

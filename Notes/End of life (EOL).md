# End of life (EOL)

End of life (EOL) is the stage in a productâ€™s lifecycle when the manufacturer or developer stops providing active updates and feature development but may still offer limited support. This designation applies to both hardware and software products. Once a product reaches EOL, it typically transitions toward end of service life (EOSL), at which point all forms of support cease.

Using products at the EOL stage is risky because they gradually stop receiving security patches, increasing vulnerability to exploitation. While basic support might still be available, the lack of updates means organizations should begin planning migrations to supported versions or alternatives to avoid reaching the EOSL stage unprepared.

Manufacturers often announce EOL timelines in advance, giving users time to plan for upgrades or replacements. Despite these warnings, EOL products are sometimes still used due to cost, compatibility concerns, or lack of awareness, exacerbating potential security risks.

# System on chip (SoC)

A system on chip (SoC) is an integrated circuit that combines multiple components of a computer or electronic system into a single chip. SoCs typically include a processor, memory, input/output interfaces, and other essential hardware needed for a complete computing system. They are commonly used in mobile devices, embedded systems, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices due to their compact size and power efficiency.

- **Integrated components:** Combines CPU, GPU, RAM, storage controllers, and other essential hardware on a single chip.
- **Power efficiency:** Designed for low power consumption, making them ideal for battery-powered devices.
- **Compact design:** Reduces the physical size of electronic devices by eliminating the need for separate components.
- **Optimized performance:** Custom-built for specific applications, balancing performance and efficiency.
- **Common applications:** Used in smartphones, tablets, IoT devices, gaming consoles, and embedded systems.

SoCs enable modern electronics to be smaller, more efficient, and cost-effective, making them essential for portable and embedded computing solutions.

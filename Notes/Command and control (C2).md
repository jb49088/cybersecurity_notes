# Command and control (C2)

Command and control (C2) refers to the systems and processes used to direct and manage activities within an organization or operation, often in a military, security, or cyber context. In the context of cybersecurity, C2 is associated with managing the operations of cybercriminals or malicious actors, who use C2 servers to control compromised systems (e.g., botnets or malware) remotely.

C2 in a cybersecurity context is typically used to:

- **Send commands**: Malicious actors can issue instructions to infected devices or networks.
- **Maintain communication**: C2 servers enable constant communication between the attacker and compromised systems, allowing for remote management.
- **Exfiltrate data**: C2 channels are used to steal sensitive data from the targeted systems.

C2 is a critical part of many cyberattacks, including those involving malware like ransomware, spyware, and botnets. Detecting and disrupting C2 communication is a key focus of cybersecurity efforts, as it can significantly hinder the attackerâ€™s ability to control and expand their attack.

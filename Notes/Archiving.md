# Archiving

Archiving involves the long-term storage of data to ensure accessibility and compliance with legal, regulatory, or organizational requirements. Proper archiving practices are critical for supporting operations, maintaining records, and mitigating risks associated with data breaches or loss.

It takes an average of about nine months for a company to identify and contain a breach, according to the IBM Security Report (2022). This highlights the importance of having access to historical data to support investigations and remediation efforts. Archiving ensures that important data is preserved over an extended period, enabling businesses to retrieve and analyze it when needed.

In some cases, archiving is not just a best practice but a requirement. State and federal laws, as well as organizational policies, may mandate the retention of specific types of data for predefined periods.

Effective archiving supports operational continuity, enhances compliance, and provides a reliable means of accessing critical historical information.

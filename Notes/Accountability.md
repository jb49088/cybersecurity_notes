# Accountability

Accountability ensures that actions within a system are traceable to specific users or entities. It involves tracking and logging user activities to provide an audit trail, ensuring that any actions performed can be reviewed and attributed to an individual or process. Accountability helps organizations detect unauthorized actions, investigate security incidents, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements by maintaining a record of who did what, when, and why.

# Bus Topology

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork topology]]

A bus topology is the simplest. It consists of a single cable that runs to every workstation, as shown in Figure 2.26. This topology uses the least amount of cabling. Each computer shares the same data and address path. With a bus topology, messages pass through the trunk, and each workstation checks to see if a message is addressed to it. If the address of the message matches the workstation‚Äôs address, the network adapter retrieves it. If not, the message is ignored.

Cable systems that use the bus topology are easy to install. You run a cable from the first computer to the last computer. All of the remaining computers attach to the cable somewhere in between. Because of the simplicity of installation, and because of the low cost of the cable, bus topology cabling systems are the cheapest to install.

Although the bus topology uses the least amount of cabling, it is difficult to add a workstation. If you want to add another workstation, you have to reroute the cable completely and possibly run two additional lengths of it. Also, if any one of the cables breaks, the entire network is disrupted. Therefore, such a system is expensive to maintain and can be difficult to troubleshoot. You will rarely run across physical bus networks in use today.

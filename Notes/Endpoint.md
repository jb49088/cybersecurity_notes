# Endpoint

An endpoint is any device that connects to a network, serving as an entry or exit point for data. Common examples include desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, servers, and IoT devices. Endpoints are critical in IT infrastructure, as they directly interface with users and are often the target of cyberattacks.

Endpoints are particularly vulnerable because they can host sensitive data, access network resources, and are often exposed to external threats. Securing endpoints involves deploying endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, enforcing strong authentication, applying regular updates and patches, and ensuring proper configurations. Endpoint security measures also include implementing firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption to safeguard data.

Effective endpoint management ensures that these devices are compliant with organizational security policies, reducing risks and improving overall network integrity. As organizations adopt remote work and mobile computing, securing endpoints has become a cornerstone of cybersecurity strategies.

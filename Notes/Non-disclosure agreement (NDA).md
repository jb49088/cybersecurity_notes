[[üè∑Ô∏èBusiness agreement]]

A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is a formal contract between parties that establishes confidentiality and restricts the sharing of specific information. NDAs are designed to protect sensitive information from being disclosed to unauthorized individuals or organizations.

- **Confidentiality agreement:** The NDA ensures that any information covered by the agreement remains confidential and is not disclosed without permission.
- **Protects confidential information:** This includes trade secrets, business activities, intellectual property, or any other information specified in the NDA.
- **Unilateral or bilateral:** NDAs can be one-way (unilateral) when only one party shares information, or mutual (bilateral or multilateral) when all parties exchange confidential information.
- **Formal contract:** NDAs are legally binding documents, and signatures are typically required from all involved parties.

NDAs are commonly used in business negotiations, partnerships, and employment agreements to safeguard sensitive information and establish trust between parties.

# Active directory (AD)

Active directory (AD) is a centralized directory service primarily used in Windows-based environments to manage and organize network resources.

- **Comprehensive Network Database**: AD serves as a centralized repository containing information about all network resources, including computers, user accounts, file shares, printers, and groups.
- **Authentication Management**: Users authenticate to the network using their Active Directory credentials, enabling secure and streamlined login processes.
- **Centralized Access Control**:  Administrators can manage permissions and determine which users or groups have access to specific network resources, ensuring proper security and organization.
- **Help Desk Utility**: Commonly utilized by IT support teams for tasks like resetting passwords, adding new accounts, or removing inactive ones.

Active Directory provides a robust framework for managing users, devices, and resources across a network, promoting efficient administration and enhanced security.

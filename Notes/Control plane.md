# Control plane

The control plane is the component of a network or system responsible for managing and directing traffic and operational decisions. It handles tasks such as routing, policy enforcement, and signaling.

Key responsibilities:

- **Configuration Management:** Distributes settings to the data plane.
- **Routing Decisions:** Determines optimal paths for traffic.
- **Policy Enforcement:** Applies rules and access controls.

The Control Plane is distinct from the data plane, which handles actual data movement.

# Honeyfiles

A honeyfile is a cybersecurity technique that involves placing decoy files on a system or network with the intention of luring attackers into interacting with them. These files are designed to appear valuable or interesting to cybercriminals, yet they are carefully monitored and isolated to prevent any actual damage. Honeyfiles are commonly used to detect unauthorized access or malicious activity, especially in environments where sensitive data is stored.

Unlike honeypots, which focus on luring attackers to a decoy system or application, honeyfiles specifically target files that attackers might attempt to access or exfiltrate. When an attacker interacts with a honeyfile—whether by downloading, modifying, or copying the file—security teams are alerted to the intrusion attempt, providing valuable insights into the attacker's tactics, techniques, and procedures.

The primary goal of honeyfiles is to gather intelligence on how attackers operate and to divert them from real, sensitive data. By analyzing the attacker's actions, security professionals can strengthen defenses, improve file protection mechanisms, and enhance overall network security.

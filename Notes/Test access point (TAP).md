# Test access point (TAP)

A test access point (TAP) is a hardware device used in network environments to capture, monitor, and analyze wireless traffic. It provides a way to intercept and examine the data being transmitted over a wireless network without affecting the performance or security of the network itself. TAPs are commonly used for troubleshooting, performance monitoring, and security analysis.

- **Traffic capture**: Intercepts and copies wireless network traffic for analysis, allowing administrators to inspect packet-level data.
- **Performance monitoring**: Helps network professionals track the performance and health of wireless networks by capturing traffic and identifying issues such as congestion or interference.
- **Security analysis**: TAPs can be used to detect unauthorized access or malicious activity on the network by providing a detailed view of the wireless communication.

A TAP can be deployed at various points within a network to provide visibility into specific areas of the network, especially in large or complex wireless environments. It is often used alongside network analyzers or intrusion detection systems (IDS) to enhance network security and reliability.

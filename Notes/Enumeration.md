# Enumeration

Enumeration is the process of systematically identifying and gathering information about networked systems, services, and user accounts. In cybersecurity, attackers and security professionals use enumeration to map out targets, discover vulnerabilities, and assess security risks. It typically follows the reconnaissance phase in an attack or security assessment.

- **Network enumeration**: Identifies active hosts, open ports, and running services within a network. Tools like Nmap and Netcat are commonly used for this purpose.
- **User enumeration**: Attempts to list valid usernames or accounts on a system. This can be done through responses to login attempts, error messages, or poorly configured authentication mechanisms.
- **Service enumeration**: Gathers details about available services, such as FTP, SMB, or DNS, to identify potential attack vectors or misconfigurations.
- **SNMP enumeration**: Uses Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to extract detailed information about network devices, including system configurations and running processes.
- **Active Directory enumeration**: In Windows environments, attackers may query Active Directory to retrieve user lists, group memberships, and organizational structures.

Enumeration is a critical step in both offensive security (ethical hacking and penetration testing) and defensive security (hardening systems against attacks). Organizations can mitigate enumeration risks by enforcing strong authentication, limiting publicly available system details, and monitoring for suspicious network activity.

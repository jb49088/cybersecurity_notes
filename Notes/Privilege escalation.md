# Privilege escalation

Privilege escalation is the process of exploiting a vulnerability or weakness in a system to gain higher levels of access than what was originally granted. It typically occurs in two forms: vertical and horizontal.

- **Vertical privilege escalation:** Involves gaining higher privileges, such as from a regular user to an administrator or root user. This is often done by exploiting flaws in the system's software, misconfigurations, or weak passwords.
- **Horizontal privilege escalation:** Occurs when an attacker gains access to other users' privileges without increasing their own level of access. For example, a user may gain access to another userâ€™s account with the same level of permissions, but without administrative rights.

Privilege escalation is a critical concern for system administrators because once an attacker has elevated privileges, they can perform actions such as installing malware, exfiltrating sensitive data, or making unauthorized changes to the system.

# Cloud access security broker (CASB)

A cloud access security broker (CASB) is a security solution that acts as an intermediary between users and cloud services to enforce security policies, monitor activity, and provide visibility and control over data and applications in the cloud. CASBs help organizations ensure that their use of cloud services complies with security policies, industry regulations, and governance standards.

- **Visibility:** Provides insight into cloud service usage, including unauthorized or shadow IT applications being used within the organization.
- **Data Security:** Helps protect sensitive data through encryption, tokenization, and data loss prevention (DLP) policies.
- **Access Control:** Enforces policies around user authentication and access, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access specific cloud resources.
- **Threat Protection:** Identifies and mitigates security threats, such as malware, suspicious user behavior, or compromised accounts, by analyzing user activity and cloud interactions.
- **Compliance Monitoring:** Helps organizations maintain compliance with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS by ensuring proper controls are in place for data handling and storage.

A CASB is essential for organizations adopting cloud services, as it helps bridge the security gap between on-premises infrastructure and cloud environments, ensuring secure access and protecting sensitive data.

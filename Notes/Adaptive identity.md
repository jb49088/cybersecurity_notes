# Adaptive identity

Adaptive identity refers to a dynamic approach to managing and authenticating user identities based on contextual factors. It leverages real-time analytics and machine learning to adjust authentication requirements or access levels.

Key features include:

- **Context Awareness:** Considers factors such as device type, location, and user behavior.
- **Risk-Based Authentication:** Adjusts security requirements based on detected risks.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Reduces friction for low-risk activities while increasing security for high-risk ones.

Adaptive Identity is commonly used in Zero Trust architectures to balance security with user convenience.

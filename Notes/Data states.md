# Data states

Data can exist in different states throughout its lifecycle, each requiring specific protections and handling procedures to ensure security and integrity.

- **Data at rest:** This refers to data that is stored on physical or cloud-based storage devices and is not actively being accessed or transferred. Data at rest needs to be encrypted and protected through access controls to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
- **Data in transit:** Data in transit is actively moving across networks, such as during communication between servers or when transmitted over the internet. It must be secured using encryption protocols like TLS/SSL to protect it from interception or tampering during transfer.
- **Data in use:** Data in use is actively being processed, accessed, or modified by applications or users. While in this state, data is vulnerable to unauthorized access or attacks. Secure access controls and encryption techniques must be employed to protect the data while it is being utilized.

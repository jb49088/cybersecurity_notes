# ORDER BY

[[üè∑Ô∏èSQL]]

`ORDER BY` sequences the records returned by a query based on a specified column or columns. This can be in either ascending or descending order.

## Sorting in ascending order

To use the `ORDER BY` keyword, write it at the end of the query and specify a column to base the sort on. In this example, SQL will return the `customerid`, `city`, and `country` columns from the `customers` table, and the records will be sequenced by the `city` column from A to Z:

```sql
SELECT customerid, city, country
FROM customers
ORDER BY city;
```

```
+------------+--------------+----------------+
| customerid | city         | country        |
+------------+--------------+----------------+

The `ORDER BY` keyword sorts the records based on the column specified after this keyword. By default, as shown in this example, the sequence will be in ascending order. This means

- if you choose a column containing numeric data, it sorts the output from the smallest to largest. For example, if sorting on `customerid`, the ID numbers are sorted from smallest to largest.
- if the column contains alphabetic characters, such as in the example with the¬†`city` column, it orders the records from A to Z.

## Sorting in descending order

You can also use the `ORDER BY` with the `DESC` keyword to sort in descending order. The `DESC` keyword is short for "descending" and tells SQL to sort numbers from largest to smallest, or alphabetically from Z to A:

```sql
SELECT customerid, city, country
FROM customers
ORDER BY city DESC;
```

```

```

Now, cities at the end of the alphabet are listed first.

## Sorting based on multiple columns

You can also choose multiple columns to order by. For example, you might first choose the `country` and then the `city` column. SQL then sorts the output by `country`, and for rows with the same `country`, it sorts them based on `city`. You can run this to explore how SQL displays this:

```sql
SELECT customerid, city, country
FROM customers
ORDER BY country, city;
```

```

[[üè∑Ô∏èPolicy]]

A Social Engineering Policy is a set of guidelines and procedures designed to protect an organization from social engineering attacks, which exploit human psychology to gain unauthorized access to information, systems, or physical locations. The primary objective of this policy is to raise awareness among employees, establish preventive measures, and ensure a structured response to potential social engineering threats.

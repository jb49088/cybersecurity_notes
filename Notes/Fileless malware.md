[[üè∑Ô∏èMalware]] 

Fileless malware is a sophisticated form of malicious software that operates without the need to install any files on a victim's computer or device. Instead of relying on traditional files, fileless malware resides in the computer's memory, often exploiting vulnerabilities in software or leveraging legitimate system tools and processes to carry out its malicious activities. This makes it particularly difficult to detect using conventional antivirus software, which typically scans for files or suspicious activity on the hard drive.

Fileless malware can be used for various malicious purposes, including data theft, system compromise, and creating backdoors for further attacks. Since it operates in memory, it often leaves little to no trace on the file system, making it harder for security tools and analysts to identify and remove.

# Self-encrypting drives (SED)

Self-encrypting drives (SED) are storage devices that automatically encrypt data at the hardware level, providing built-in security without requiring user intervention. SEDs use encryption algorithms to protect data at rest, ensuring that even if a drive is stolen or removed, its contents remain inaccessible without proper authentication.

SEDs are commonly used in enterprise environments, government agencies, and industries that require strong data protection. They enhance security while maintaining high performance, as encryption and decryption occur in hardware without impacting system resources.

- **Hardware-based encryption:** Encryption is performed by the drive itself, eliminating reliance on software-based encryption solutions.
- **Transparent operation:** Encryption is automatic and does not require user action, reducing the risk of misconfiguration.
- **Authentication protection:** Requires a password, PIN, or cryptographic key to decrypt and access data.
- **Performance efficiency:** Minimal impact on system performance since encryption is handled by dedicated hardware.
- **Compliance support:** Helps organizations meet regulatory requirements for data security, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.

Self-encrypting drives provide a seamless and effective way to protect sensitive data, making them a valuable security measure for organizations handling confidential information.

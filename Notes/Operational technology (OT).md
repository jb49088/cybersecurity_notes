# Operational technology (OT)

Operational technology (OT) refers to the hardware and software systems used to monitor and control physical processes, devices, and infrastructure in industries such as manufacturing, energy, transportation, and utilities. OT is distinct from information technology (IT) in that it focuses on managing industrial operations rather than data processing.

- **Industrial control systems (ICS):** OT includes systems like **supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)** and **distributed control systems (DCS)**, which help manage critical industrial processes.
- **Real-time operations:** OT systems often require real-time monitoring and control to ensure the safety and efficiency of physical processes.
- **Cyber-physical systems:** OT integrates digital control with physical systems, making it essential for industries like power plants, oil refineries, and water treatment facilities.
- **Security challenges:** Historically, OT systems were isolated from the internet, but increased connectivity through **Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)** has introduced cybersecurity risks.
- **IT and OT convergence:** Modern organizations are integrating OT with IT to improve efficiency, but this also requires enhanced security measures to protect critical infrastructure.

As industries become more automated and connected, securing and maintaining operational technology is crucial for ensuring safety, reliability, and efficiency.

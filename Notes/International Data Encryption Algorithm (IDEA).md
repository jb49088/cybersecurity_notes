[[üè∑Ô∏èSymmetric encryption algorithm]]

The International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) is a symmetric block cipher designed by Xuejia Lai and James Massey in 1991. It operates on 64-bit blocks of data and uses a 128-bit key, providing robust encryption through a series of modular arithmetic, bitwise XOR, and substitution operations.

IDEA consists of eight rounds of encryption, followed by a final transformation step, ensuring strong diffusion and confusion. It was initially patented and widely used in applications such as PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) for secure communications.

Although IDEA was considered secure for a long time, it has been largely superseded by modern ciphers like AES, which offer better performance and are subject to more widespread cryptographic scrutiny.

[[üè∑Ô∏èHash function]]

RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest (RIPEMD) is a family of cryptographic hash functions designed to produce fixed-length hash values from input data of arbitrary size. It was developed in 1996 by Hans Dobbertin, Antoon Bosselaers, and Bart Preneel as part of the European Union's RIPE project.

RIPEMD comes in various versions, including RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-160, RIPEMD-256, and RIPEMD-320. Of these, RIPEMD-160 is the most commonly used, generating a 160-bit hash value that offers stronger security than its predecessors.

RIPEMD was developed as an alternative to algorithms like MD5 and SHA-1, focusing on providing resistance to collisions and other cryptographic vulnerabilities. Although it remains secure, RIPEMD is less widely used than modern alternatives like SHA-2 and SHA-3.

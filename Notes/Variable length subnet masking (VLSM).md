[[üè∑Ô∏èNetworking]]

Variable length subnet masking (VLSM) is a subnetting technique that allows different subnet masks to be assigned within the same network, optimizing IP address allocation. Unlike traditional fixed-length subnetting, VLSM enables more efficient use of IP address space by allocating subnet sizes based on actual need rather than a fixed structure.

- **Efficient IP allocation:** Reduces wasted addresses by assigning subnet masks based on host requirements.
- **Supports hierarchical subnetting:** Allows networks to be divided into subnets of varying sizes to accommodate different use cases.
- **Minimizes address exhaustion:** Helps conserve IP addresses, especially in IPv4 networks with limited address availability.
- **Requires classless routing protocols:** Works with routing protocols like RIPv2, OSPF, and EIGRP that support Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR).
- **Improves network scalability:** Allows more flexible and scalable network designs by accommodating networks of different sizes.

VLSM is widely used in enterprise networks and service provider environments to optimize IP address utilization and improve routing efficiency.

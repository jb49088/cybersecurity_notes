[[üè∑Ô∏èMalware]] 

A **boot sector virus** is a type of malware that infects the master boot record (MBR) of a computer's hard drive or removable storage device (e.g., USB drive). This virus is activated when the system is booted up, before the operating system loads. Boot sector viruses can spread when an infected storage device is connected to an uninfected system. They can be particularly damaging as they can prevent the system from booting correctly and make it difficult to remove the virus without wiping the hard drive or reformatting the storage device.

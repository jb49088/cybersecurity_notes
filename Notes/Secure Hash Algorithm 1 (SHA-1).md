[[üè∑Ô∏èHash function]]

Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) is a cryptographic hash function developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and published by NIST in 1995. It produces a 160-bit hash value from input data and was widely used for data integrity verification, digital signatures, and cryptographic applications.

SHA-1 processes data in 512-bit blocks and applies a series of transformations to produce a fixed-length output. However, advances in cryptanalysis revealed vulnerabilities to collision attacks, where two distinct inputs generate the same hash value.

Due to its weaknesses, SHA-1 is deprecated in favor of more secure algorithms like SHA-2 and SHA-3 for most cryptographic purposes.

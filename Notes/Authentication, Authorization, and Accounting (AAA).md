# Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)

[[üè∑Ô∏èFramework]]

AAA refers to a framework used to manage and secure access to systems and networks. It involves three key processes:

- **Authentication:** Verifying the identity of users or systems before granting access.
  <br>
- **Authorization:** Determining the level of access or permissions a user or system has after authentication.
  <br>
- **Accounting:** Tracking user activity and system usage for auditing and billing purposes.

AAA ensures that only authorized users can access resources, controls their level of access, and provides a way to monitor and log their actions for security and compliance.

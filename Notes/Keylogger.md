[[üè∑Ô∏èMalware]] 

Keyloggers are a type of surveillance software or hardware designed to record every keystroke made on a computer or mobile device. Often used maliciously, keyloggers can capture sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal data without the user's knowledge. While some keyloggers are used for legitimate purposes, such as monitoring employee activity or parental control, they are most commonly associated with cybercriminals seeking to steal private information for identity theft, fraud, or other illicit activities.

Keyloggers can operate in the background without noticeable signs, making them difficult to detect. They may be installed via malicious downloads, phishing attacks, or vulnerabilities in software. Protecting against keyloggers involves using strong antivirus programs, enabling multi-factor authentication, regularly updating software, and being cautious of suspicious downloads or links.

# ps, kill & killall

[[üè∑Ô∏èLinux command]]

The `ps`, `kill` and `killall` commands are all used to manage processes in Linux.

The `ps` command is used to display information about the current running processes on the system. Here are some examples of using the `ps` command:

Display a list of all running processes:

`ps -ef`

Display a list of all processes for a specific process ID (PID):

`ps -p PID`

Let‚Äôs see all of this in action:

`ps`
`kill <process ID`
`killall <process name>`

For demonstration purposes, we will create a shell script with an infinite loop and will run it in the background.

With the use of the `&` symbol, we can pass a process into the background. As you can see, a new bash process with PID 25098 is created.

Now, to kill a process with the `kill` command, you can type `kill` followed by the PID(Process Id) of the process.

But if you do not know the process ID and just want to kill the process with the name, you can make use of the killall command.

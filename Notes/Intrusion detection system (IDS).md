# Intrusion detection system (IDS)

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a security tool that monitors network or system activities for malicious activity or policy violations. It alerts administrators when suspicious behavior is detected but does not take direct action to prevent it.

IDS can be categorized into two main types:

- **Network-based IDS (NIDS):** Monitors network traffic for signs of potential attacks or malicious behavior.
- **Host-based IDS (HIDS):** Operates on individual systems, analyzing activity on the device itself.

Detection methods used by IDS include:

- **Signature-based detection:** Looks for predefined patterns or signatures of known attacks.
- **Anomaly-based detection:** Detects deviations from a baseline of normal behavior, which may signal a new or unknown threat.
- **Behavioral analysis:** Analyzes the behavior of network traffic or system activities to identify potential threats based on deviations from established patterns.

Benefits of IDS include increased visibility into network activity and alerting administrators to potential threats. However, IDS does not actively block malicious activity and relies on human intervention for response.

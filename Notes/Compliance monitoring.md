# Compliance monitoring

Compliance monitoring is the process of ensuring that an organization adheres to regulatory requirements, internal policies, and industry standards. It is an ongoing activity that helps maintain operational integrity, reduce risks, and demonstrate accountability.

- **Ensure compliance in daily operations**: Compliance monitoring involves regular checks to ensure that daily activities align with established rules and guidelines.    
- **Due diligence and due care**:
    - **Due diligence** refers to investigating and verifying compliance, often related to third-party activities.
    - **Due care** focuses on internal actions, requiring an organization to act honestly and in good faith to maintain compliance.
- **Attestation and acknowledgment**: Formal compliance documentation often requires someone to "sign off," assuming responsibility for its accuracy. Incorrect documentation can lead to accountability issues.
- **Internal and external monitoring**: Monitoring involves using internal tools and processes to track compliance within the organization. It may also require sharing information or providing access to third parties, ensuring that all external operations meet compliance standards.
- **Automation**: Automation is essential for large organizations to efficiently manage compliance processes. Many third-party systems help collect and compile data from various sources, streamlining the monitoring and reporting tasks.

Compliance monitoring is vital for mitigating risks, maintaining operational transparency, and meeting regulatory expectations. By combining diligent oversight, automation, and collaborative practices, organizations can ensure consistent adherence to standards.

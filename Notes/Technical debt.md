# Technical debt

Technical debt refers to the long-term cost incurred by choosing an easy or quick solution in the short term, instead of investing in a more robust and maintainable one. Over time, this "debt" accumulates, leading to challenges such as decreased efficiency, increased maintenance costs, and difficulty in implementing new features.

- **Code quality**: Technical debt often arises from suboptimal code or workarounds that prioritize speed over quality. This can result in poorly structured or difficult-to-maintain code, which leads to greater future effort to make changes or fix bugs.
- **Lack of documentation**: Inadequate or missing documentation can contribute to technical debt, as it becomes harder for new developers to understand and maintain the system, leading to inefficiencies and errors.
- **Legacy systems**: Over time, older systems or software may not meet current needs or may be difficult to upgrade. Maintaining these legacy systems can become a significant form of technical debt, especially when integration with modern technologies is challenging.
- **Refactoring and updates**: Regularly refactoring code, updating dependencies, and improving system architecture can help manage technical debt, but neglecting these tasks can lead to further complications down the line.
- **Balancing speed and quality**: Technical debt is often the result of trade-offs between fast delivery and long-term maintainability. While it's sometimes necessary to take shortcuts to meet deadlines, managing these decisions carefully helps avoid accumulating unmanageable debt.

Managing technical debt involves making strategic decisions to balance short-term goals with long-term system health. Addressing it proactively helps ensure scalability, maintainability, and ease of future development.

# Data Structures 

Data structures are vital for efficiently managing and securing data. They organize information in ways that facilitate quick access and manipulation, which is crucial for tasks like threat detection, incident response, and managing security logs. Key data structures such as hash tables and trees support effective searching and storage, enabling robust security measures and faster responses to potential threats.

## Integer

Represents whole numbers without a fractional component. Examples include 0, 1, 42, etc. Integers can be signed (positive or negative) or unsigned (positive only). 

## Float

[[Data|Data]] consisting of a number with a decimal point.

## Character

 Represents single characters, such as letters, digits, or special symbols. Examples include 'a', 'Z', '7', '$', etc. Characters are often represented using ASCII or Unicode encoding.

## Boolean

[[Data|Data]] that can only be one of two values: either True or False. Boolean variables are often used in conditional statements and logical operations.

## Array

An array is a number of elements in a specific order, typically all of the same type (depending on the language, individual elements may either all be forced to be the same type, or may be of almost any type). Elements are accessed using an integer index to specify which element is required. Typical implementations allocate contiguous memory words for the elements of arrays (but this is not always a necessity). Arrays may be fixed-length or resizable.

## Stack

## Queue

## List 

A list is a linear collection of data elements of any type, called nodes, where each node has itself a value, and points to the next node in the linked list. The principal advantage of a linked list over an array is that values can always be efficiently inserted and removed without relocating the rest of the list. Certain other operations, such as [random access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_access "Random access") to a certain element, are however slower on lists than on arrays.

## Tree

## Graph

## Hash Tables

## Struct/Record

Represents a composite data type consisting of multiple fields or members, each with its own data type. Structs are used to encapsulate related data into a single unit.

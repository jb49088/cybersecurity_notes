[[üè∑Ô∏èNetworking device]]

A bridge is a network device used to connect and filter traffic between two or more network segments. it operates at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model and helps improve network efficiency by reducing collisions and dividing network traffic intelligently.

- **Traffic filtering:** Examines MAC addresses to determine whether to forward or block network traffic between segments.
- **Collision domain separation:** Reduces network congestion by segmenting traffic, preventing unnecessary data from propagating across the entire network.
- **Transparent operation:** Does not modify data packets but forwards them based on MAC addresses, making the bridging process seamless.
- **Types of bridges:** Includes local bridges (connecting segments within the same network) and remote bridges (linking networks over a larger distance).
- **Difference from switches:** While both operate at layer 2, switches provide more advanced functionality by offering multiple ports and reducing traffic congestion more effectively.

Bridges are useful for extending networks, improving performance, and ensuring efficient data flow in environments where multiple network segments need to communicate.

# Intrusion prevention system (IPS)

An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is a proactive security measure that monitors network traffic and actively blocks or mitigates potential threats. Unlike IDS, which only detects and alerts, an IPS can take immediate action to stop attacks.

IPS can be categorized into two main types:

- **Network-based IPS (NIPS):** Monitors network traffic for signs of malicious behavior and blocks any detected attacks in real-time.
- **Host-based IPS (HIPS):** Monitors the activity on individual systems, analyzing behavior and blocking malicious activity before it can cause damage.

Detection methods used by IPS include:

- **Signature-based detection:** Detects known threats by comparing network traffic to a database of attack signatures.
- **Anomaly-based detection:** Identifies suspicious behavior based on deviations from established patterns of normal activity.
- **Behavioral analysis:** Analyzes the behavior of network traffic to identify potential threats.

Benefits of IPS include active threat prevention and automated responses, improving overall network security. However, it can have limitations, such as the potential for false positives and increased system resource requirements.

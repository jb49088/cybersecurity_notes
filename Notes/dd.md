# dd

[[🏷️Linux command]]

This command was created to convert and copy files from multiple file system formats. In the current day, the command is simply used to create bootable USB for Linux but there still are some things important you can do with the command.

The `dd` command in Linux is a versatile command used for low-level copying and conversion of data. It stands for “data-description” or “data definition,” and it can be used to copy and convert data between different file formats and storage devices.

For example, if we wanted to back up the entire hard drive as is to another drive, we would use the `dd` command.

`dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sda`

The if and of arguments stand for input file and output file.

It’s a powerful and flexible tool, but it can also be dangerous if not used carefully. Always double-check your syntax and make sure you know what the command will do before executing it.

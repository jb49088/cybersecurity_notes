# Jailbreaking ‚ÅÑ Rooting

Jailbreaking and rooting refer to processes that remove software restrictions imposed by the operating system on mobile devices. While they allow users to gain full administrative control (root access) over their devices, these processes also introduce significant security and stability risks.

- **Jailbreaking (iOS):** Removes Apple's restrictions, enabling installation of unauthorized apps, tweaks, and system modifications.
- **Rooting (Android):** Grants root access, allowing users to modify or replace system files, install custom firmware, and bypass restrictions.

## Risks:

- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Root access can expose devices to malware and malicious apps.
- **Loss of Warranty:** Device warranties are typically voided by jailbreaking or rooting.
- **System Instability:** Unapproved modifications can lead to crashes, errors, or degraded performance.
- **Reduced App Compatibility:** Some apps may refuse to run on jailbroken or rooted devices.

While jailbreaking or rooting may provide customization and additional functionality, users must weigh the benefits against the risks and potential legal or policy violations.

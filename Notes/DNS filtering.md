[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork security]]

DNS filtering is a security measure that controls internet access by filtering domain name system (DNS) queries, blocking connections to malicious or inappropriate sites before a connection is established.

- **DNS Lookup**: Before connecting to a website, DNS filtering intercepts the DNS query to resolve the domain name into an IP address.
- **Real-Time Threat Intelligence**: Uses constantly updated threat intelligence from both commercial and public sources to identify and block harmful domains.
- **Blocking Harmful Sites**: Prevents access to malicious or unwanted sites by refusing to resolve their DNS queries, effectively making them inaccessible.
- **Broad Applicability**: DNS filtering works for any DNS lookup, providing protection that extends beyond standard web filtering.

By intercepting and analyzing DNS queries, DNS filtering provides a proactive layer of security, stopping threats and enforcing policies at the domain level before connections are established.

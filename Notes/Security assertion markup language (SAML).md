[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork protocol]]

Security assertion markup language (SAML) is an open standard used for authentication and authorization, allowing secure single sign-on (SSO) across different applications and systems.

- **Open standard for authentication and authorization:** Allows users to authenticate through a third-party identity provider to gain access to services or resources without re-entering credentials.
- **Centralized authentication:** Uses assertions to transfer authentication data between identity providers and service providers, simplifying the authentication process.
- **Not originally designed for mobile apps:** SAML was initially designed for web-based applications, and its integration with mobile applications has been a challenge.

SAML plays a crucial role in enabling secure, federated identity management and streamlining access across various platforms and services.

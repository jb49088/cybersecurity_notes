# Uninterruptible power supply (UPS)

An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is a device that provides backup power to electronic systems in the event of a power failure. It helps to ensure that devices such as computers, servers, and network equipment continue to operate smoothly without interruption when the main power source is disrupted.

A UPS typically contains a battery that kicks in when there is a power outage or voltage fluctuations. It can supply enough power to keep the connected systems running long enough for users to save data and safely shut down the equipment or to maintain operations until alternative power is restored.

UPS systems come in different sizes and capabilities:

- **Offline/Standby UPS**: Provides power when the main power fails.
- **Line-interactive UPS**: Regulates voltage and provides battery backup.
- **Online/Double-conversion UPS**: Continuously provides power, using the battery to supply a steady stream of power.

The main benefits of a UPS include maintaining system uptime, preventing data loss, and protecting against damage from power surges.

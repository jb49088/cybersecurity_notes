# Cookie

A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored by a web browser on a user's device. It is used to remember information about the user, such as login credentials, preferences, or tracking details, to provide a more personalized and efficient browsing experience.

Key characteristics of cookies:

- **Data storage:** Cookies store information such as user settings, session identifiers, or items in a shopping cart. This data allows websites to remember the user across sessions.
- **Types of cookies:**
    - Session cookies are temporary and are deleted when the user closes the browser.
    - Persistent cookies remain on the user's device for a specified period, even after the browser is closed.
    - Third-party cookies are set by domains other than the one the user is visiting, often used for tracking across different websites.
- **Security considerations:** Cookies can be vulnerable to attacks like session hijacking or cross-site scripting (XSS). Secure cookies should be transmitted over HTTPS and marked as HttpOnly to prevent access from client-side scripts.

Cookies help improve user experience by enabling websites to remember user preferences and streamline interactions.

# Risk register

A risk register is a critical tool for documenting and managing risks associated with projects or organizational activities. It serves as a centralized repository for identifying, assessing, and tracking risks, enabling effective mitigation and monitoring.

- **Document project risks effectively:** Identify risks, record potential impacts and probabilities, and outline mitigation strategies. Regularly update the register to adapt to evolving risks.
- **Monitor and manage risks:** Implement mitigation strategies for each risk and track the outcomes to ensure effective control.
- **Utilize key risk indicators (KRIs):** Develop measurable factors to identify and monitor risks early, minimizing potential impacts.
- **Assign responsibility through risk ownership:** Designate individuals to oversee specific risks, ensuring accountability and effective management.
- **Define and respect risk thresholds:** Establish acceptable risk levels where mitigation efforts are economically justified.

A well-maintained risk register fosters proactive risk management, enhancing clarity, accountability, and resilience.

# Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology that uses electromagnetic fields to wirelessly transfer data between a tag (or badge) and a reader. It is commonly used for access control, asset tracking, and identification purposes. While RFID offers convenience and efficiency, it can also be vulnerable to certain security risks.

RFID systems can be exploited in various ways. For instance, attackers can intercept the communication between the RFID tag and reader to clone or manipulate the tag's data. This could allow unauthorized access to restricted areas or the theft of valuable information.

To protect against RFID security breaches, modern systems implement encryption, secure channels, and advanced authentication methods. However, many older or improperly configured RFID systems remain vulnerable to hacking.

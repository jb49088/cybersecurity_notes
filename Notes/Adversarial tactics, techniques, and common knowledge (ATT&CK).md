# Adversarial tactics, techniques, and common knowledge (ATT&CK)

Adversarial tactics, techniques, and common knowledge (ATT&CK) is a framework created by MITRE to document and categorize the behaviors, tactics, and techniques used by cyber adversaries. It provides a structured way to understand, detect, and respond to cyber threats, helping organizations strengthen their defenses against real-world attacks.

- **Tactics:** Represent the high-level objectives that attackers aim to achieve, such as gaining initial access, maintaining persistence, or exfiltrating data.
- **Techniques:** Detail the specific methods used to accomplish these objectives, such as phishing, lateral movement, or data compression.
- **Sub-techniques:** Offer granular details about how a particular technique is executed, providing deeper insights into attack behaviors.
- **Threat intelligence mapping:** Organizations can map observed adversary actions to ATT&CK techniques, enabling better understanding and response.

The ATT&CK framework is widely used for threat modeling, red teaming, and optimizing defensive strategies. By offering a shared language for describing adversary behavior, it has become a valuable tool for cybersecurity professionals.

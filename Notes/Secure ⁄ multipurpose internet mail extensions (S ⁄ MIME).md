# Secure/multipurpose internet mail extensions (S/MIME)

Secure/multipurpose internet mail extensions (S/MIME) is a standard for securing email communication through encryption and digital signatures. S/MIME enhances the security of email by ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the message content. It is widely used to protect sensitive information in email communications and is supported by most modern email clients.

S/MIME is based on a combination of asymmetric (public-key) cryptography for encryption and digital certificates for authentication. It enables users to send encrypted emails, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read the message, and to sign emails to verify their sender's identity.

- **Email encryption:** Protects the contents of an email, ensuring only the recipient with the appropriate private key can decrypt and read it.
- **Digital signatures:** Verifies the authenticity and integrity of the email message, preventing tampering or impersonation.
- **Certificate-based authentication:** Uses digital certificates to authenticate the sender, ensuring trust and identity verification.
- **Interoperability:** Works with most email clients, making it a widely accepted standard for secure email communication.
- **Mime extensions:** S/MIME is an extension of the MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standard, enabling it to support multimedia email content, such as attachments.

S/MIME is an essential tool for businesses and individuals who require secure email communication to protect sensitive data from interception, tampering, and fraud.

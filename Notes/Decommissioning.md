# Decommissioning

Decommissioning refers to the process of securely retiring systems, particularly storage devices, to ensure that sensitive data is not exposed or recoverable by unauthorized parties. It is a critical step in maintaining data security and preventing inadvertent leaks.

This process should follow a formal policy to prevent mishandling. Simply discarding devices without proper measures can result in data recovery by malicious actors. Decommissioning is primarily associated with storage devices like hard drives, SSDs, and USB drives, which often contain sensitive or proprietary information.

There are several approaches to decommissioning physical devices. Devices can be securely wiped and recycled for use in another system, ensuring data is thoroughly removed before reuse. Alternatively, devices can be physically destroyed to render the data unrecoverable. The chosen method depends on the sensitivity of the data and organizational policies.

Decommissioning is a vital practice for safeguarding data during the disposal or repurposing of storage devices, helping organizations maintain security and compliance.

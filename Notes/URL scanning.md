# URL scanning

URL scanning is a method used to control access to online content by analyzing and categorizing Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), also referred to as Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). It is a fundamental feature in modern network security tools.

- **Access Control**: Administrators manage traffic through allow lists and block lists, specifying which URLs are permitted or restricted.
- **Category Management**: URLs are grouped into categories like auctions, hacking, malware, travel, and recreation, enabling streamlined enforcement of access policies.
- **Limitations**: URL scanning has limited control, as not all internet activity relies on URLs, leaving potential gaps in coverage for non-URL-based access methods.
- **Integration with NGFW**: Often integrated into next-generation firewalls (NGFWs), URL scanning helps filter traffic based on specific URLs or broader categories.

URL scanning enhances network security and policy enforcement by analyzing and controlling web access, ensuring compliance and protecting against harmful or inappropriate content.

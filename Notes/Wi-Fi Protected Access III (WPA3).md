# Wi-Fi Protected Access III (WPA3)

[[üè∑Ô∏èNetwork protocol]]

WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access III) was introduced in 2018 as the latest security protocol for Wi-Fi networks, enhancing the security features of its predecessors, WPA and WPA2.

## Key Features of WPA3:

1. **Enhanced Encryption**: WPA3 uses stronger encryption methods, specifically the 192-bit security suite, which provides a higher level of security for sensitive data.
   <br>
2. **Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)**: This replaces the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) method used in WPA2, offering better protection against brute-force attacks. SAE allows for secure key exchange even if the password is weak.
   <br>
3. **Forward Secrecy**: WPA3 provides forward secrecy, meaning that if a session key is compromised, past sessions remain secure. This is particularly important for protecting historical data.
   <br>
4. **Improved Security for Public Networks**: WPA3 includes a feature called "Opportunistic Wireless Encryption" (OWE) for open networks, which encrypts traffic on public Wi-Fi without requiring a password, enhancing security for users on unsecured networks.
   <br>
5. **Easy Connect**: This feature simplifies the process of connecting devices to a Wi-Fi network, particularly for IoT devices, by allowing users to scan a QR code or use NFC.
   <br>
6. **Robust Security for High-Density Environments**: WPA3 is designed to provide improved performance and security in environments with many connected devices, like stadiums and airports.
   
WPA3 aims to provide a more secure wireless experience, addressing vulnerabilities and improving user authentication. While it‚Äôs gradually being adopted, many devices still use WPA2, and WPA3 is designed to be backward compatible with WPA2 networks.

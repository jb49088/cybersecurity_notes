# Data loss prevention (DLP)

Data loss prevention (DLP) is a security framework designed to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access, leakage, or loss. By monitoring and controlling the movement of data across systems, DLP helps organizations safeguard critical assets like financial information, personal identifiers, and intellectual property.

- **Identify and protect sensitive data:** DLP focuses on recognizing and securing critical information such as personal, financial, or health data across various systems.
- **Prevent unauthorized data transfers:** The goal is to stop data from being accessed or transferred by unauthorized individuals, preventing data breaches and leaks.
- **Managing multiple sources and destinations:** With data originating from various sources and being sent to numerous destinations, DLP solutions must be implemented across different locations within the network to effectively manage risks.
- **Cloud-based protection:** Cloud-based DLP solutions monitor network traffic to detect and prevent data loss without requiring on-site hardware or software installations.
- **Monitor network traffic:** These solutions track all network communications, ensuring that sensitive data is not being transferred inappropriately or without authorization.
- **Customizable data protection rules:** DLP tools allow for the creation of custom policies to identify and block specific data patterns or types unique to the organization, ensuring targeted protection.
- **Control web access and transfers:** By managing access to certain websites or blocking data transfers to cloud storage platforms, DLP helps prevent the unauthorized sharing of sensitive information.
- **Block malicious threats:** DLP systems also help block harmful content, such as viruses or malware, that may pose a risk to data security as it moves through the network.

DLP is a critical security tool for protecting sensitive data, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations, and preventing potential data breaches across organizational networks.

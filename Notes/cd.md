# cd 

[[üè∑Ô∏èLinux command]]

While working within the terminal, moving around within directories is pretty much a necessity. The cd command is one of the important Linux commands you must know, and it will help you navigate through directories. Just type `cd` followed by directory, as shown below.

`cd <directory path>`

As you can see in the above command, I simply typed `cd /etc/` to get into the /etc directory. We used the `pwd` command to print the current working directory.

# Operating system (OS)

An operating system (OS) is a foundational platform that powers computers and devices, making it an essential part of daily operations. Its importance also makes it a prime target for cyberattacks.

Operating systems are remarkably complex, consisting of millions of lines of code. The larger the codebase, the more opportunities there are for security vulnerabilities. These flaws may already exist within the OS, but they might not be discovered until an attacker exploits them.

Because of this complexity, keeping an OS secure requires constant vigilance, patching, and updates to address newly discovered vulnerabilities and prevent potential exploitation.

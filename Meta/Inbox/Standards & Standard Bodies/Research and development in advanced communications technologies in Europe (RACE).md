# Research and development in advanced communications technologies in Europe (RACE)

Research and development in advanced communications technologies in Europe (RACE) was a major initiative within the European Union aimed at advancing the development of communication technologies. The program was launched in the late 1980s and focused on driving research and innovation to create the foundation for future communication systems in Europe.

RACE aimed to establish Europe as a global leader in communication technologies by fostering collaboration among European research institutions, industry players, and government bodies. The program covered various aspects of telecommunications, including mobile networks, broadband, satellite communication, and data transmission technologies.

- **Innovative technologies:** Focused on cutting-edge areas like broadband transmission, satellite communications, and multimedia services.
- **Collaboration across Europe:** Promoted cooperation between European countries and stakeholders to boost research outcomes and technological advancements.
- **Paving the way for modern networks:** Laid the groundwork for the development of the European telecommunication infrastructure, including technologies used in the internet and mobile communication.
- **Predecessor to future initiatives:** Served as a precursor to more recent European research programs such as Horizon 2020, which continued the emphasis on advancing communication technologies.

RACE played a pivotal role in shaping the development of European communication infrastructure and contributed to Europeâ€™s leadership in global telecommunications.

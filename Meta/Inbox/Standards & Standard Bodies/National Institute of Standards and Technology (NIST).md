# National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a U.S. federal agency under the Department of Commerce that develops and promotes standards, guidelines, and best practices for science, technology, and cybersecurity. Founded in 1901, NIST plays a critical role in advancing innovation and ensuring reliable, secure systems across industries.

## Contributions to Cybersecurity

NIST is widely recognized for its work in cryptography and cybersecurity, publishing frameworks and guidelines that are globally adopted. Notable contributions include:

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):** A risk-based approach to managing and improving cybersecurity posture.
  <br>
- **FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards):** Standards for cryptographic algorithms like AES and SHA.
  <br>
- **SP (Special Publications):** Detailed guidelines, such as SP 800-63 (Digital Identity) and SP 800-53 (Security and Privacy Controls).

NISTâ€™s work ensures the development of robust security measures for government systems and serves as a foundation for best practices in the private sector.

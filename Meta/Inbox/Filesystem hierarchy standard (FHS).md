# Filesystem hierarchy standard (FHS)

The filesystem hierarchy standard (FHS) is a key component in Linux that defines how the data and files within the system are organized. It outlines the directory structure, ensuring consistency across various Linux distributions and other Unix-like systems.

- **Directory structure**: FHS outlines a standardized directory tree layout that organizes files into distinct directories based on their function and type.
- **Benefits**: FHS ensures consistency across distributions, making it easier for users and administrators to understand and navigate the system. It also aids in system maintenance and troubleshooting by standardizing where files are stored.
- **Compliance**: Most major Linux distributions, along with other Unix-like systems, adhere to FHS for their directory structure.

This diagram illustrates the hierarchy of relationships under the FHS:

The FHS provides a standard that simplifies system administration, file management, and user interaction with the filesystem.

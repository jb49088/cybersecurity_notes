| **Control**           | **Least privilege**                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **Issue(s)**          | Access to the internal folder was not limited to the sales team and the manager. The business partner should not have been given permission to share the promotional information to social media.                                           |
| **Review**            | NIST SP 800-53: AC-6 addresses how an organization can protect their data privacy by implementing least privilege. It also suggests control enhancements to improve the effectiveness of least privilege.                                   |
| **Recommendation(s)** | Restrict access to sensitive resources based on user role and regularly audit user privileges.                                                                                                                                              |
| **Justification**     | Data leaks can be prevented if shared links to internal files are restricted to employees only. Also, requiring managers and security teams to regularly audit access to team files would help limit the exposure of sensitive information. |

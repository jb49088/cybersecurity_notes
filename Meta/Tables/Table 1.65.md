| **AC-6** | **Least Privilege**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **AC-6** | **Control:** <br>Only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task or function should be provided to users.                                                                                                                             |
| **AC-6** | **Discussion:** <br>Processes, user accounts, and roles should be enforced as necessary to achieve least privilege. The intention is to prevent a user from operating at privilege levels higher than what is necessary to accomplish business objectives.  |
| **AC-6** | **Control enhancements:** <br>- Restrict access to sensitive resources based on user role. <br>- Automatically revoke access to information after a period of time. <br>- Keep activity logs of provisioned user accounts. Regularly audit user privileges. |

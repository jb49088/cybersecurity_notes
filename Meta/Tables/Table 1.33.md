| One security measure the team plans to implement to protect against brute force attacks is to disallow previous passwords from being used. Since the vulnerability that lead to this attack was the attacker’s ability to use a default password to log in, it’s important that we prevent any old passwords such as default passwords from being used to reset the password. Another supportive measure is to require more frequent password updates, so in case any unauthorized person becomes aware of the password, they are less likely to be able to use that password if the password is updated sooner than later. Finally, another helpful solution is to implement two-factor authentication (2FA). 2FArequires authentication via a password and also by confirming a one-time passcode (OTP) sent to either their email or phone. Once the user confirms their identity through their login credentials and the OTP, they will gain access to the system. Any malicious actor that attempts a brute force attack will not likely gain access to the system because it requires additional authentication. |

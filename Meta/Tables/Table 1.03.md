| **Topology** | **Advantages**                                                                         | **Disadvantages**                                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Bus**      | Cheap. Easy to install.                                                                | Difficult to reconfigure. A break in the bus disables the entire network.      |
| **Star**     | Cheap. Very easy to install and reconfigure. More resilient to a single cable failure. | More expensive than bus.                                                       |
| **Ring**     | Efficient. Easy to install.                                                            | Reconfiguration is difficult. Very expensive.                                  |
| **Mesh**     | Best fault tolerance.                                                                  | Reconfiguration is extremely difficult, extremely expensive, and very complex. |
| **Hybrid**   | Gives a combination of the best features of each topology used.                        | Complex (less so than mesh, however).                                          |
